# Low-Risk Phase 1: Documentation/Config Recommendations

**Status**: Active
**Source**: 2026-05-07 evaluation, findings F-005, F-025, F-028, F-024
**Priority**: P1
**Branch**: sam/implement-low-risk-phase-01kr0f (PR #925)

## Problem

The 2026-05-07 codebase evaluation identified four low-risk documentation/config improvements. Two (F-005, F-025) are already implemented in PR #925. Two remain: F-028 (missing `.claude/settings.json`) and F-024 (constitution vs enforced file-size limit drift).

## Research Findings

### F-005 / F-025 (already in PR #925)
- AGENTS.md reduced from 410 to 87 lines
- CLAUDE.md reduced from 293 to 246 lines
- 8 new nested AGENTS.md files added (all 11 packages now covered)
- All acceptance criteria met per task file

### F-028: Missing `.claude/settings.json`
- No `.claude/settings.json` exists in the repo
- Agents must manually approve common commands (pnpm, gh, git, etc.)
- Evaluation recommends allow-list for safe commands, avoiding destructive ones
- Must NOT include overbroad permissions (no rm -rf, no force push, etc.)

### F-024: Constitution File-Size Limit Drift
- Constitution Principle IV: "files under 400 lines"
- Rule 18: 500-line warning, 800-line mandatory split
- Quality script (`check-file-sizes.ts`): HARD_LIMIT=800, WARN_LIMIT=500
- 107 files exceed 400 lines, 61 exceed 500, 10 exceed 800
- Evaluation recommends amending constitution to match enforced 500/800
- Decision: smallest compatible change — amend constitution Principle IV

## Implementation Checklist

- [x] Verify F-005 implementation (instruction budget reduction)
- [x] Verify F-025 implementation (nested AGENTS.md files)
- [x] F-028: Create `.claude/settings.json` with minimal safe permissions
- [x] F-024: Amend constitution Principle IV file-size limits to match enforced 500/800
- [ ] Update task file and PR description

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] F-005 and F-025 verified as complete
- [x] `.claude/settings.json` exists with documented, non-overbroad permissions
- [x] Constitution Principle IV file-size limit matches enforced thresholds
- [x] No runtime code changes
- [ ] All changes pushed to PR #925 branch (NOT merged)

## Implementation Notes

### F-028: `.claude/settings.json` Permissions Rationale
Allowed commands are restricted to safe, non-destructive operations:
- **Build tools**: `pnpm`, `npm`, `npx`, `tsx`, `go` — standard build/test/run
- **GitHub CLI**: `gh pr`, `gh run`, `gh workflow`, `gh api` — PR and CI management
- **Git (safe subset)**: status, log, diff, branch, fetch, add, commit, push, worktree, rebase, stash, remote, show, rev-parse, merge-base — everyday workflow operations
- **Wrangler**: Cloudflare Workers CLI for deploys and dev
- **Utilities**: `curl`, `ls`, `wc`, `find`, `mkdir`, `mv`, `cp` — basic file operations

Excluded (require manual approval):
- `rm` — file deletion needs human judgment
- `git reset`, `git checkout --`, `git clean` — destructive git operations
- `git push --force` — blocked by deny list convention, not in allow list
- `docker` — container operations have side effects

### F-024: Constitution Amendment
- Constitution Principle IV line 85: changed "files under 400 lines" to "files under 500 lines, mandatory split above 800 lines"
- Version bumped 1.8.0 → 1.8.1 (PATCH — clarification, no new principles)
- This aligns the constitution with `.claude/rules/18-file-size-limits.md` and `scripts/quality/check-file-sizes.ts`
