# VM Size Minimum Selection

## Problem

Project/task VM size selection currently resolves a requested size, but node reuse treats size as a soft preference. This means a task that requests `large` can reuse an existing or warm `medium` node when no exact large node is available.

The intended behavior is minimum-capacity semantics: smaller work may run on larger nodes, but larger work must not run on smaller nodes.

## Research Findings

- Project default VM size is stored on `projects.defaultVmSize` / `default_vm_size` in `apps/api/src/db/schema.ts`.
- Task submit resolves VM size as explicit task value, then agent profile override, then project default, then platform default in `apps/api/src/routes/tasks/submit.ts`.
- TaskRunner auto-provisioning creates new nodes with `state.config.vmSize` in `apps/api/src/durable-objects/task-runner/node-steps.ts`.
- Hetzner provider maps abstract `large` to `cx43` in `packages/providers/src/hetzner.ts`.
- The bug is in reuse selection: warm and existing nodes sort by exact size match but do not reject undersized nodes.
- Staging D1 inspection on 2026-05-01 found no project currently set to `default_vm_size = 'large'`, so the exact reported incident could not be confirmed from persisted staging state.
- Task records do not persist the resolved requested VM size, which makes post-hoc auditing harder. Deferred to `tasks/backlog/2026-05-01-persist-task-requested-vm-size.md` because the current bug fix is scoped to enforcing minimum-size node selection.

## Implementation Checklist

- [x] Add shared helper that compares VM sizes as ordered capacity tiers.
- [x] Use the helper in standalone node selector warm-node filtering.
- [x] Use the helper in standalone node selector existing-node filtering.
- [x] Use the helper in TaskRunner warm-node filtering.
- [x] Use the helper in TaskRunner existing-node filtering.
- [x] Reject explicitly selected preferred nodes that are smaller than requested.
- [x] Add tests proving larger nodes satisfy smaller requests and smaller nodes do not satisfy larger requests.
- [x] Add behavioral tests for standalone selector VM-size filtering.
- [x] Add behavioral tests for TaskRunner preferred, warm, and existing node VM-size filtering.
- [x] Add bug-fix post-mortem and process rule update.
- [x] Defer resolved requested VM-size audit persistence to a backlog task.
- [x] Run focused tests and typechecks.
- [x] Run full lint/typecheck/test validation.
- [x] Complete `/do` specialist review and staging verification.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `small` requests can use `small`, `medium`, or `large` nodes.
- [x] `medium` requests can use `medium` or `large` nodes.
- [x] `large` requests only use `large` nodes.
- [x] Warm-node reuse follows the same minimum-size rule.
- [x] Existing-node reuse follows the same minimum-size rule.
- [x] Explicit preferred node selection cannot bypass the minimum-size rule.
- [x] Staging verification confirms the deploy/smoke path; full live VM provisioning was not run to avoid node quota/cost, with VM-size behavior covered by behavioral tests.

## Validation Log

- 2026-05-01: Focused builds/tests/typechecks passed for `shared`, `providers`, `cloud-init`, and `api`.
- 2026-05-01: `pnpm lint` passed with existing warnings.
- 2026-05-01: `pnpm typecheck` passed.
- 2026-05-01: Initial `pnpm test` run exposed an unrelated `ButtonGroup` assertion that depended on CSS zero-value serialization.
- 2026-05-01: Fixed the `ButtonGroup` test to accept equivalent `0` / `0px` style serialization.
- 2026-05-01: `pnpm --filter @simple-agent-manager/ui test -- ButtonGroup` passed.
- 2026-05-01: Full `pnpm test` rerun passed: 19 packages successful.
- 2026-05-01: Constitution review found duplicate hardcoded VM-size rank table; replaced it with ordering derived from `DEFAULT_VM_SIZE_VCPUS`.
- 2026-05-01: Test review found source-contract-only coverage for selector paths; added behavioral coverage for standalone selector and TaskRunner node selection.
- 2026-05-01: `pnpm --filter @simple-agent-manager/api test -- durable-objects/task-runner-node-selection services/node-selector` passed.
- 2026-05-01: `pnpm --filter @simple-agent-manager/shared test -- vm-sizes` passed with unknown requested-size fallback coverage.
- 2026-05-01: `pnpm --filter @simple-agent-manager/shared typecheck` passed.
- 2026-05-01: `pnpm --filter @simple-agent-manager/api typecheck` passed.
- 2026-05-01: Added post-mortem `docs/notes/2026-05-01-vm-size-minimum-selection-postmortem.md`.
- 2026-05-01: Updated `.claude/rules/10-e2e-verification.md` with compatibility-constraint selection coverage requirements.
- 2026-05-01: Final full `pnpm lint` passed with existing warnings.
- 2026-05-01: Final full `pnpm typecheck` passed.
- 2026-05-01: Final full `pnpm test` passed: 19 packages successful.
- 2026-05-01: Test-engineer re-check passed; prior coverage findings addressed.
- 2026-05-01: Constitution re-check passed; prior hardcoded rank finding addressed.
- 2026-05-01: Cloudflare review passed with no blocking findings.
- 2026-05-01: Task-completion-validator re-check attempts timed out after stale initial findings; `needs-human-review` label added to PR #875 and merge deferred.
- 2026-05-01: GitHub CI passed all required implementation checks except Specialist Review Evidence, which intentionally fails because task-completion-validator did not complete.
- 2026-05-01: Staging deploy workflow `25232215432` passed for branch `sam/possible-opinion-bug-terms-01kqje`, including Cloudflare deployment and smoke-tests.
- 2026-05-01: Additional local one-off staging browser smoke attempt reached token-login successfully but could not launch Chromium because the workspace is missing the Playwright browser binary; the GitHub staging smoke-tests job is the live browser evidence.
