# Wave 1C Deployment Membership Auth

## Problem Statement

Deployment and infrastructure project routes still gate project access through `requireOwnedProject()`, so active project admins cannot see or manage shared project deployment resources. Wave 1C migrates only the deployment/infrastructure route family to membership and capability authorization while preserving `userId` as actor, credential, and audit attribution.

## Scope

- Migrate only:
  - `apps/api/src/routes/deployment-custom-domains.ts`
  - `apps/api/src/routes/deployment-environment-config.ts`
  - `apps/api/src/routes/deployment-environment-lifecycle.ts`
  - `apps/api/src/routes/deployment-environments.ts`
  - `apps/api/src/routes/deployment-releases.ts`
  - `apps/api/src/routes/deployment-secrets.ts`
  - `apps/api/src/routes/deployment-volumes.ts`
  - `apps/api/src/routes/project-deployment.ts`
- Do not migrate sibling project/chat/task/workspace or automation/context route families.
- Do not change credential attribution or deployment node ownership semantics in this wave.

## Research Findings

- Membership foundation is present in `apps/api/src/middleware/project-auth.ts` with `requireProjectAccess()` and `requireProjectCapability()`.
- Admin members have every project capability except `project:delete`; this matches v1 shared-project UX decisions where owner and admin are effectively full access except owner-only project deletion and transfer.
- Existing deployment routes use `requireOwnedProject()` only as the project authorization gate. Many helpers still use `userId` for actor attribution or user-scoped cloud/node/registry credentials and should remain unchanged in Wave 1C.
- Read-oriented deployment routes should require project membership visibility (`requireProjectAccess()` or `deployment:read` where capability is clearer).
- Writes should use focused capabilities: `deployment:deploy` for release submission, `deployment:manage` for environments/custom domains/volumes/lifecycle/destructive operations, `secret:read`/`secret:write` for deployment secrets/runtime config, and `infra:manage` for GCP backing deployment infrastructure credential setup/removal.
- The deployment identity token route is MCP-token authenticated and not a session membership route; its project check remains token-project matching. The GCP OAuth callback does need membership/capability validation after state validation.
- Hono middleware leak postmortems require keeping per-route auth and not introducing wildcard middleware.

## Implementation Checklist

- [x] Replace `requireOwnedProject()` imports and calls in the eight scoped route files with `requireProjectAccess()` or `requireProjectCapability()` using route-appropriate capabilities.
- [x] Preserve current `userId` usage for created-by/audit fields, OAuth state identity, deployment provisioning, image resolution, node proxy calls, and credential/node service calls.
- [x] Update route comments that describe owner-only authorization where touched.
- [x] Add focused route tests proving an active admin member can access representative migrated deployment routes and a non-member is rejected.
- [x] Run a grep check proving no `requireOwnedProject` usage remains in the eight scoped files.
- [x] Run relevant API/unit tests and broader quality gates required by `/do`.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Active admin members can access representative deployment read and write routes for projects they do not own.
- Non-members are rejected from migrated deployment routes.
- Deployment secret/runtime-config routes use secret capabilities.
- Deployment release submission uses deploy capability.
- Environment lifecycle, custom domain, volume, destructive environment, and deployment infrastructure management routes use management capabilities.
- Existing actor/audit/credential attribution remains based on the active session user.
- No `requireOwnedProject` call sites remain in the eight scoped files.

## Validation Evidence

- Focused route tests passed: `pnpm --filter @simple-agent-manager/api test -- tests/unit/routes/deployment-membership-auth.test.ts tests/unit/routes/deployment-custom-domains.test.ts tests/unit/routes/deployment-volumes.test.ts tests/unit/routes/deployment-release-compose-submission.test.ts tests/unit/routes/deployment-release-provisioning.test.ts tests/unit/routes/deployment-environment-observability.test.ts tests/unit/routes/deployment-environment-lifecycle-vertical.test.ts tests/unit/routes/deployment-custom-domains-vertical.test.ts tests/unit/routes/project-deployment.test.ts` (9 files, 73 tests).
- Scoped grep check passed: no `requireOwnedProject` matches in the eight scoped route files.
- Review fix added coverage proving an admin member can read deployment logs from an owner-created deployment node without reintroducing a `nodes.userId = active user` project-access boundary.
- `pnpm lint` passed with existing warnings only.
- `pnpm typecheck` passed.
- `pnpm test` passed: turbo 19/19 tasks successful, including API 367 files / 5688 tests and web 206 files / 2548 tests.
- `pnpm build` passed.
- `$task-completion-validator` passed before archive: research findings map to checklist items, checked items map to the diff, acceptance criteria have automated or command evidence, no UI data path applies, no new multi-resource selector applies, and the route-level test provides vertical coverage for membership authorization.

## Workflow Notes

- Specialist reviews, PR creation, CI, staging verification, merge, and cleanup are tracked in `.do-state.md` per the `/do` workflow after this implementation task is archived.
