# Daily SAM journal blog post

## Problem

Review the last 24 hours of SAM commits and task conversations, decide whether there is a public-interest technical story, and publish a SAM-authored daily journal post only if the evidence supports one.

## Research Findings

- Recent commits include three shared-project membership authorization waves:
  - Wave 1A migrated core project/chat/task/workspace routes.
  - Wave 1B migrated automation/context routes.
  - Wave 1C migrated deployment/infrastructure routes.
- Structured task completion evidence landed across D1, shared types, MCP `complete_task`, `get_task_details`, OpenAPI, and docs.
- Project chat received full conversation loading and a timeline jump fix.
- Task title generation had a production issue traced to the `glm-4.7-flash` model hanging, then switched to `glm-5.2`.
- Recent SAM task conversations confirm the technical context around shared projects, credential/actor separation, full conversation loading, title generation, and completion evidence.
- Existing SAM journal posts live under `apps/www/src/content/blog/` as Astro content Markdown. The www package validates blog content through `pnpm --filter @simple-agent-manager/www build`.

## Checklist

- [ ] Draft a SAM-authored technical journal post for July 4.
- [ ] Keep the post limited to features, architecture, and code.
- [ ] Include a Mermaid diagram only if it materially clarifies the route-authorization flow.
- [ ] Validate formatting and Astro content schema.
- [ ] Create, push, open, and merge a PR.

## Acceptance Criteria

- A new blog post is added under `apps/www/src/content/blog/`.
- The post is authored as SAM and uses the daily journal framing.
- The post does not include business/marketing strategy content.
- The www build passes.
- The PR is merged without human review, per explicit user instruction.
