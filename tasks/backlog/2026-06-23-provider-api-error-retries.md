# Provider API Error Retries

## Problem

Claude Code can fail a prompt with a provider-originated internal error wrapped by ACP/JSON-RPC:

```text
Task failed: {"code":-32603,"message":"Internal error: API Error: 500 {\"type\":\"error\",\"error\":{\"type\":\"api_error\",\"message\":\"Internal server error\"},\"request_id\":\"req_011CcLMjaKVmvLwnVCBsLoLn\"}"}
```

SAM already retries some transient ACP prompt provider failures, but this observed `500 api_error` shape is not classified as retryable. The experimental Go harness also returns LLM provider errors immediately. Transient provider-side failures should get bounded exponential backoff consistently across agent harnesses where it is safe to retry.

## Research Findings

- `packages/vm-agent/internal/acp/session_host_prompt.go` already wraps ACP `Prompt()` with bounded retry. Retry is intentionally limited to hard `Prompt()` errors before an ACP response is accepted so user-message persistence and synthetic broadcasts happen once.
- `packages/vm-agent/internal/acp/session_host_prompt.go:isTransientProviderPromptError()` currently classifies `529`, `429`, `503`, overload, rate limit, and temporary-unavailable strings, but not `API Error: 500` with provider `api_error`.
- `packages/vm-agent/internal/config/config.go` already exposes `ACP_PROMPT_RETRY_MAX_RETRIES`, `ACP_PROMPT_RETRY_INITIAL_BACKOFF`, and `ACP_PROMPT_RETRY_MAX_BACKOFF`; no new VM-agent retry env vars are expected for the ACP path.
- `packages/harness/agent/loop.go` calls `provider.SendMessage()` directly and stops the run on any provider error.
- `packages/harness/llm/types.go` exposes a small `Provider` interface. A retrying provider wrapper can make retry policy reusable without expanding the agent loop.
- Prior archive `tasks/archive/2026-06-02-acp-prompt-transient-retry.md` established the key safety boundary: retrying the same prompt is acceptable only for hard provider errors before completion, and cancellation/crash/timeout behavior must remain unchanged.
- Relevant rules: `.claude/rules/11-fail-fast-patterns.md`, `.claude/rules/14-do-workflow-persistence.md`, `.claude/rules/35-vertical-slice-testing.md`.

## Checklist

- [ ] Add focused ACP tests proving the observed `500 api_error` shape is retryable.
- [ ] Extend transient provider classification to include provider-originated `500 api_error`, `502`, and `504` gateway-style failures while keeping generic local/internal errors non-retryable.
- [ ] Preserve cancellation, deadline, crash recovery, timeout, and non-retryable internal error behavior.
- [ ] Add a reusable retrying `llm.Provider` wrapper in `packages/harness` with bounded exponential backoff, injectable sleeper, and transcript-visible retry events.
- [ ] Add Go tests for harness retry success, retry exhaustion, non-retryable behavior, and cancellation/deadline behavior.
- [ ] Run focused Go tests for `packages/vm-agent/internal/acp` and `packages/harness`.
- [ ] Run broader quality checks as practical before PR.
- [ ] Move this task to `tasks/archive/` after validation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The pasted Claude/Anthropic-style `API Error: 500` with `api_error` is retried by the ACP prompt path instead of immediately failing the task.
- Generic local/internal ACP errors, cancellation, deadline, crash recovery, and prompt timeout behavior are not retried.
- `packages/harness` has a reusable provider retry wrapper that can be applied consistently to LLM provider calls.
- Retry attempts remain bounded, use exponential backoff, support cancellation, and emit observable retry/exhaustion information.
- Tests prove the new retry classification and harness wrapper behavior.

## Workflow Gates

- [ ] Run `$go-specialist`, `$test-engineer`, `$constitution-validator`, and `$task-completion-validator` review before PR.
- [ ] Complete staging deployment and VM-agent infrastructure verification because this touches `packages/vm-agent`: provision a real staging workspace, confirm heartbeat, verify workspace/agent session access, and clean it up.
- [ ] Open a PR from `sam/task-failed-code-32603messageinternal-01kvtf`, wait for CI, merge only when green, then monitor production deploy.
