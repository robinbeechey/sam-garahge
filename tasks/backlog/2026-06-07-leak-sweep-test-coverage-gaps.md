# Leak-sweep test coverage gaps (follow-up from PR #1245)

## Problem

A late-arriving test-engineer review of PR #1245 (harden github-webhook owner
guard + residual leak-row sweep, merged as `634bb8a3`) found MEDIUM/LOW test
coverage gaps. No CRITICAL/HIGH findings; the shipped behavior is correct and
covered for the happy path. These are coverage-hardening follow-ups deferred
per rule 25 (MEDIUM/LOW may be deferred to backlog).

All 42 existing tests pass; none are source-contract tests.

## Findings

### MEDIUM

- **M1 — cursor (`afterId`) path untested.** The SQL-filter test calls
  `bulkSweepMismatchedPersonalInstallations` with no `afterId`, so it only
  asserts `installationsWhere[0]` equals `eq(accountType, 'personal')`. When
  `afterId` is supplied the WHERE becomes `and(personalFilter, gt(id, afterId))`
  — that composite branch is never exercised. A refactor that drops the personal
  filter from the cursor-path `and(...)` would not be caught.
- **M2 — fake `makeSweepDb` does not filter by WHERE.** The boundary mock always
  returns `opts.installations` regardless of the WHERE clause, so org-row
  exclusion is verified only by asserting the drizzle expression shape, not by
  proving an org row would actually be skipped under real D1 execution. The test
  comment acknowledges this; no integration-level test closes the gap.

### LOW

- **L1 — user `githubId` cache untested.** Two rows with the same `userId`
  should query the DB once and reuse the cached value; no test covers this.
- **L2 — progress-interval log branch (`processed % 25 === 0`) unreachable** with
  current test batch sizes (max 3 rows). Logging only, no control flow.
- **L3 — login-only fallback in `personalInstallationOwnerMatches` not covered
  via the webhook path.** All three new webhook tests supply numeric ids; the
  login-string fallback is only exercised by the pre-existing OAuth/sync tests.
- **L4 — admin route body-parsing untested.** `admin-github-installation-leak-sweep.ts`
  parses `body.limit`/`body.afterId` with defensive guards; none of this is
  exercised, so `afterId` forwarding from the HTTP layer is untested end-to-end.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] M1: add a test that passes `{ afterId }` and asserts the recorded WHERE
      still includes the personal-type filter (composite `and(...)` branch).
- [ ] M2: either make the fake DB filter by `accountType`, or add an
      integration-level test proving org rows are not processed/deleted.
- [ ] L1: add a two-rows-same-user test asserting one `users` query + cache reuse.
- [ ] L3: add a webhook-path test with non-numeric ids exercising the login
      fallback (insert on login match / skip on mismatch).
- [ ] L4: add admin-route tests for `limit` cap, floor, and `afterId` forwarding.
- [ ] L2: optional — exercise the progress-interval log with a >25-row batch.
