## Summary

- Describe the problem and the intended change.
- Include any critical implementation notes for reviewers.

## Validation

- [ ] `pnpm lint`
- [ ] `pnpm typecheck`
- [ ] `pnpm test`
- [ ] Additional validation run (if applicable)

## Staging Verification (REQUIRED for all code changes — merge-blocking)

All checkboxes below are mandatory for any PR that changes runtime code (`.ts`, `.tsx`, `.go`, etc.). Write `N/A: docs-only` ONLY if the PR contains zero runtime code changes. See `.claude/rules/13-staging-verification.md`.

- [ ] **Staging deployment green** — `Deploy Staging` workflow triggered manually and passed for this branch
- [ ] **Live app verified via Playwright** — logged into `app.sammy.party` (staging) using test credentials and actively tested the application
- [ ] **Existing workflows confirmed working** — navigated dashboard, projects, and settings; confirmed no regressions in core flows (pages load, data displays, navigation works, no new console errors)
- [ ] **New feature/fix verified on staging** — the specific changes in this PR work correctly on the live staging environment (describe what was tested below)
- [ ] Infrastructure verification completed — VM provisioned and heartbeat confirmed (required for changes to cloud-init, VM agent, DNS, TLS, scripts/deploy). Write `N/A: no infra changes` ONLY if the PR does not touch any infrastructure paths.
- [ ] Mobile and desktop verification notes added for UI changes

### Staging Verification Evidence

<!-- Describe what you tested on staging and what you observed. Include screenshots, API responses, or Playwright observations. -->
<!-- If N/A: docs-only, explain why no code was changed. -->

## UI Compliance Checklist (Required for UI changes)

- [ ] Mobile-first layout verified
- [ ] Accessibility checks completed
- [ ] Shared UI components used or exception documented
- [ ] Playwright visual audit run locally — mock data scenarios (normal, long text, empty, many items, error, special chars) tested at mobile (375x667) and desktop (1280x800); no horizontal overflow; screenshots in `.codex/tmp/playwright-screenshots/` (see `.claude/rules/17-ui-visual-testing.md`)

## End-to-End Verification (Required for multi-component changes)

- [ ] Data flow traced from user input to final outcome with code path citations (see `.claude/rules/10-e2e-verification.md`)
- [ ] Capability test exercises the complete happy path across system boundaries
- [ ] All spec/doc assumptions about existing behavior verified against code (not just "read the code")
- [ ] If any gap exists between automated test coverage and full E2E, manual verification steps documented below

### Data Flow Trace

<!-- For multi-component features, paste your data flow trace here. Each step should cite a specific file:function. -->
<!-- If not applicable, write `N/A: <reason>` -->

### Untested Gaps

<!-- Document any gaps between automated test coverage and the full user flow. Include manual verification steps performed. -->
<!-- If not applicable, write `N/A: full flow covered by automated tests` -->

## Post-Mortem (Required for bug fix PRs)

<!-- If this PR fixes a bug, fill out this section. If not a bug fix, write `N/A: not a bug fix`. -->

### What broke

<!-- Describe the user-visible failure in 1-2 sentences -->

### Root cause

<!-- Trace to the specific commit/change that introduced the bug -->

### Class of bug

<!-- Generalize: what category of bug is this? e.g., "state interaction race condition", "mock-hidden integration failure" -->

### Why it wasn't caught

<!-- Which practices failed? Missing test type, insufficient review, missing trace? -->

### Process fix included in this PR

<!-- List the specific files in .claude/rules/, .claude/agents/, .github/, or CLAUDE.md that were updated to prevent this class of bug -->

### Post-mortem file

<!-- Link to the task, issue, PR comment, or www docs page created for the post-mortem -->

## Specialist Review Evidence (Required for agent-authored PRs)

If local subagents were used during Phase 5, list every reviewer below. **Do NOT merge until every row shows PASS or ADDRESSED.** If any reviewer could not complete (timeout, workspace killed, error), you MUST add the `needs-human-review` label and stop — do not self-merge. See `.claude/rules/25-review-merge-gate.md`.

- [ ] **All local reviewers completed and findings addressed before merge**
- [ ] **If any reviewer did NOT complete: `needs-human-review` label added and merge deferred to human**

| Reviewer | Status | Outcome |
|----------|--------|---------|
| <!-- e.g. go-specialist --> | <!-- PASS / ADDRESSED / PENDING / FAILED --> | <!-- summary of findings or "no critical findings" --> |

<!--
Status values:
- PASS: Reviewer completed, no critical/high findings
- ADDRESSED: Reviewer completed, findings fixed in commit <hash>
- PENDING: Reviewer started but has NOT returned results — BLOCKS MERGE
- FAILED: Reviewer errored or timed out — REQUIRES HUMAN REVIEW
- DEFERRED: Findings deferred to backlog task <link> — requires justification

If this table is empty or missing rows for local reviewers, the PR is NOT ready to merge.
If this is not an agent-authored PR, write `N/A: human-authored PR`.

### Documentation & Specs

List www docs/spec files updated, or write `N/A: <reason for no updates>`.

### Constitution & Risk Check

State which constitution principles were checked and summarize key risks/tradeoffs.
