# Content Creation

Transform strategy documents, product changes, and competitive insights into publishable content drafts.

## Prerequisites — Read These First

Before creating ANY content:
1. Read `strategy/content/style-guide-raph.md` for Raph's personal writing style
2. Read `strategy/marketing/messaging-guide.md` for voice, tone, approved language
3. Read `strategy/marketing/positioning.md` for core positioning and differentiators
4. Read `strategy/competitive/` for competitive context
5. For changelogs: check `git log`, recent PRs, and `specs/`
6. For technical content: read relevant source code and architecture docs

**Never create content without reading the style guide and messaging guide first.**

## Personal Hook Requirement

Every blog post and long-form piece needs a personal hook. A real story, experience, or observation from Raph that grounds the piece. Before writing:

1. Search the repo for relevant context: `tasks/`, `specs/`, public blog content, commit history, PR descriptions, and post-mortems retained in task records
2. Check `strategy/content/` for any existing notes or hooks the human may have left
3. **If you cannot find a personal story or hook in the repo, ASK the human before writing.** Say something like: "I have the technical content but I need a personal angle. Do you have a story about how this came up, what prompted it, or what surprised you?"

Do NOT fabricate personal stories. Do NOT substitute a generic "as developers, we all know..." opening. If there's no personal hook available, ask for one.

## Platform Guide (Tech Content)

Each platform has different norms, constraints, and audiences. Content must be adapted per platform, not copy-pasted across them.

### LinkedIn

- **Audience**: Professional network. Mix of developers, engineering managers, founders, tech-adjacent people.
- **Format**: Text posts perform best. No character limit in practice, but 1,300 chars is the fold ("see more"). Front-load the hook.
- **What works**: Personal builder stories, lessons learned, contrarian takes backed by experience. "I built X and here's what surprised me" format.
- **What doesn't**: Pure announcements with no insight. Marketing-speak. Posts that read like press releases.
- **Structure**: Short paragraphs (1-3 sentences). Line breaks between them. No headers. Can use bold sparingly. End with a question or a link, not both.
- **Links**: LinkedIn deprioritizes posts with links. Put the link in a comment or at the very end. Lead with the story, not the URL.
- **Hashtags**: 3-5 max, at the end. Relevant ones like #opensource #devtools #AIagents. Don't overdo it.

### Twitter/X

- **Audience**: Developers, open-source community, tech influencers. Fast-moving.
- **Format**: 280 chars per tweet. Threads for complex topics (4-6 tweets, not 20). Always include a single-tweet variant.
- **What works**: Concrete observations, technical surprises, debugging war stories. Code snippets in screenshots. Short and direct.
- **What doesn't**: Vague teasers ("Big announcement coming!"). Marketing tone. Threads that could have been one tweet.
- **Structure**: Tweet 1 is the hook. It must stand alone. Don't start with "Thread:" or "1/". End the thread with a link and a clear takeaway.
- **Media**: Images and code screenshots increase engagement. Consider a terminal screenshot or architecture diagram.

### Bluesky

- **Audience**: Growing dev community, especially open-source and indie builders. More conversational than Twitter.
- **Format**: 300 chars per post. Threads supported. Similar to early Twitter culture.
- **What works**: Same as Twitter but slightly more relaxed. Open-source community is strong here. Genuine, not performative.
- **What doesn't**: Cross-posted Twitter content that references Twitter-specific things ("RT", "quote tweet"). Adapt, don't copy.
- **Note**: Growing quickly in dev circles. Worth posting to even if the audience is smaller.

### Mastodon / Fediverse

- **Audience**: Privacy-conscious developers, open-source advocates, European tech community. Strong overlap with SAM's values.
- **Format**: 500 chars (most instances). CW (content warnings) for topics some find sensitive. Alt text on images expected.
- **What works**: Open-source announcements, European tech angles, technical deep-dives. The audience is technical and values substance.
- **What doesn't**: Growth-hacking tone, engagement bait, "like and share" CTAs. The culture actively rejects this.
- **Instances**: Post from a relevant instance or use hashtags like #opensource #foss #devtools #selfhosted.
- **Note**: Particularly good for SAM's European/open-source angle. The Scaleway/Mistral post would resonate here.

### Hacker News

- **Audience**: Technical builders, founders, senior engineers. Skeptical, detail-oriented.
- **Format**: Title + optional text body for Show HN. Title must start with "Show HN:" for project submissions.
- **Title rules**: No clickbait, no ALL CAPS, no exclamation marks. Use the original article title or a factual description. Strip gratuitous numbers.
- **Show HN rules**: Must be something you made that people can try. Blog posts alone don't qualify as Show HN (use the blog link with a regular submission instead). Minimize signup barriers.
- **What works**: Technical honesty, trade-off acknowledgment, "here's what went wrong" stories. The debugging journey section is perfect for HN.
- **What doesn't**: Marketing language (instant death). Superlatives. Anything that sounds like a press release. Over-designed landing pages.
- **Comments**: Be present in the thread. Answer questions directly and technically. Don't get defensive.
- **Timing**: Weekday mornings US Eastern tend to get more visibility.

### Lobste.rs

- **Audience**: Invite-only community of serious programmers. Narrower and more technical than HN.
- **Format**: Link submission with tags from a predefined list. No custom tags.
- **What works**: Content that improves programming skills, deepens understanding, or would be interesting in 5-10 years. The provider abstraction pattern and debugging journey fit well.
- **What doesn't**: Startup/business content, entrepreneurship angles, product announcements disguised as blog posts. "News about companies that employ programmers" is explicitly off-topic.
- **Self-promotion**: Must be < 25% of your submissions and comments. Don't just post your own stuff.
- **Tags**: Pick from their predefined list. Likely tags for SAM content: `devops`, `practices`, `go`, `typescript`, `cloud`.
- **Note**: Requires an invite. Build presence by commenting first.

### Dev.to

- **Audience**: Broad developer community. Junior to mid-level skew. Good for tutorials and how-tos.
- **Format**: Markdown blog posts with frontmatter (title, tags, cover image). No length limit. Supports code blocks, embeds, series.
- **Tags**: Up to 4 per post. Popular relevant ones: `opensource`, `devops`, `ai`, `cloudflare`, `selfhosted`.
- **What works**: Step-by-step technical content, "how I built X" posts, debugging stories. Series format for multi-part content.
- **What doesn't**: Short link posts. Content that's purely promotional. Duplicate of your blog with no adaptation.
- **Cross-posting**: Dev.to supports canonical URLs. Cross-post the blog with `canonical_url` set to your original post for SEO.

### Reddit

Different subreddits have very different cultures. Never cross-post the same text.

**r/selfhosted** (~400k members)
- Audience: People running services on their own hardware/cloud
- What works: BYOC angle, self-hosting guide links, comparison with other platforms, "here's my setup" posts
- What doesn't: SaaS pitches, anything that requires a hosted service you control
- Format: Text post or link post. Include a comment explaining what it is and why self-hosters care

**r/devops** (~300k members)
- Audience: DevOps/platform engineers
- What works: Infrastructure abstraction patterns, multi-cloud stories, CI/CD integration
- What doesn't: AI hype, "just use our tool" posts

**r/programming** (~6M members)
- Audience: Broad programming community. Very skeptical of self-promotion
- What works: Technical blog posts about interesting engineering problems. The IP allocation/abstraction story could work
- What doesn't: Product announcements, anything that looks like marketing. Must be genuinely interesting as an engineering story

**r/opensource** (~100k members)
- Audience: Open-source enthusiasts
- What works: Project updates, contribution invitations, technical architecture posts
- What doesn't: Closed-source or freemium pitches

**r/france** (French tech threads)
- Audience: French-speaking community, broad interests
- What works: French-language posts about French tech companies. Personal stories about building from France
- Write in French. Don't just translate English marketing copy

### Product Hunt

- **When**: For major launches only, not regular content. Save for significant milestones.
- **Format**: Product page with tagline, description, screenshots, maker comment
- **What works**: Clear value prop, demo video/GIF, being present all day to answer questions
- **Timing**: Launch at 12:01 AM PT. Be available all day.
- **Note**: Not relevant for this blog post. Save for a proper launch.

### Newsletter (ontech.raphaeltm.com)

- **Audience**: Raph's existing subscribers. Already interested in his perspective.
- **Format**: Beehiiv newsletter. Can be longer and more personal than social posts.
- **What works**: The full blog post or a condensed version with personal commentary. This is where Raph's voice matters most.
- **Cross-reference**: Link to the full blog post. Include 2-3 paragraphs of the personal hook + a "read more" link.

## Content Types

### Blog Posts
Full-length technical content. Follow the style guide. Personal hook required. Code snippets verified against the codebase. Save to `strategy/content/drafts/`.

### Social Media Posts
Generate per-platform variants following the platform guide above. 2-3 variants for headlines/hooks where relevant. Always include in the same draft file as the blog post.

### Changelog / Release Announcements
Generated from git history, PRs, and feature specs. Format: What's New (feature name + why it matters + how it works), Improvements, Fixes.

### Product Launch Copy
Headline options (benefit/problem/curiosity focused), subheadline, hero section, key benefits with proof points, social proof, CTA (primary + secondary), email announcement draft.

### Developer Content (Diataxis Framework)
Identify which type: Tutorial (learning), How-to Guide (task), Explanation (understanding), Reference (information).

## Content Atomization

From one source, produce platform-native pieces (not copies):

Blog post (long-form) → LinkedIn post → Twitter/X thread + single tweet → Bluesky post → Mastodon post → HN submission → Dev.to cross-post → Reddit posts (per-subreddit) → Newsletter excerpt

Each piece is adapted to its platform. A LinkedIn post is not a shortened blog post. A Reddit post is not a LinkedIn post with different formatting.

## Output

Save drafts to `strategy/content/drafts/YYYY-MM-DD-[topic].md`
Save reusable templates to `strategy/content/templates/`

## Quality Standards

- Consistent with style guide voice and tone (no em dashes, no self-deprecation, no marketing-speak)
- Uses approved language (not banned terms from messaging guide)
- Differentiators are evidence-backed
- CTA is clear and channel-appropriate
- Platform-native formatting and tone per the platform guide
- No unverified competitive claims
- Always provide 2-3 variants for headlines, hooks, and CTAs
- Aim for 70-80% ready. Human adds brand taste and final polish
