# Architecture & Business Logic

## Stateless Design

The MVP uses a stateless architecture where workspace state is derived from:
1. **Hetzner server labels** — Metadata stored with VM
2. **Cloudflare DNS records** — Existence implies active workspace

No database is required for the MVP.

## Package Dependencies

```
@simple-agent-manager/shared
    ^
@simple-agent-manager/providers
    ^
@simple-agent-manager/api
    ^
@simple-agent-manager/web
```

Build order matters: shared -> providers -> api/web

### Adding New Features
1. Check if types need to be added to `packages/shared`
2. If provider-related, add to `packages/providers`
3. API endpoints go in `apps/api/src/routes/`
4. UI components go in `apps/web/src/components/`

## Architecture Research Requirements

Before making ANY changes related to architecture, secrets, credentials, data models, or security:

1. Research relevant architecture documentation:
   - `apps/www/src/content/docs/docs/architecture/` — Core architecture decisions
   - `apps/www/src/content/docs/docs/architecture/` — Architecture Decision Records
   - `specs/` — Feature specifications with data models
   - `.specify/memory/constitution.md` — Project principles (especially Principle XI)

2. Use sequential thinking to:
   - Understand the existing architecture
   - Identify how your change fits (or conflicts)
   - Consider security implications
   - Validate against constitution principles
   - Document your reasoning

3. Provide explicit justification for any architecture-related changes

### Key Architecture Documents

| Document | Contents |
|----------|----------|
| `apps/www/src/content/docs/docs/architecture/security.md` | BYOC model, encryption, user credentials |
| `apps/www/src/content/docs/docs/reference/configuration.md` | Platform secrets vs user credentials |
| `apps/www/src/content/docs/docs/architecture/overview.md` | Current storage and architecture model |
| `.specify/memory/constitution.md` | Core principles and rules |

### Architecture Principles (Quick Reference)

1. **Bring-Your-Own-Cloud (BYOC)**: Users provide their own Hetzner tokens. The platform does NOT have cloud provider credentials.
2. **User credentials are encrypted per-user** in the database, NOT stored as environment variables or Worker secrets.
3. **Platform secrets** (ENCRYPTION_KEY, JWT keys, CF_API_TOKEN) are Cloudflare Worker secrets set during deployment.

## Business Logic Research Requirements

Before making ANY changes related to features, workflows, state machines, validation rules, or user-facing behavior:

1. Research relevant feature specifications:
   - `specs/` — Feature specs with user stories, requirements, acceptance criteria
   - `specs/*/data-model.md` — State machines, entity relationships, constraints
   - `apps/api/src/db/schema.ts` — Current database schema and constraints
   - `apps/api/src/routes/` — Existing API behavior and validation

2. Use sequential thinking to:
   - Understand existing business rules and why they exist
   - Identify edge cases and error scenarios
   - Consider impact on existing features
   - Document your reasoning

### Key Business Logic Documents

| Document | Contents |
|----------|----------|
| `specs/003-browser-terminal-saas/spec.md` | Core SaaS features, user stories |
| `specs/003-browser-terminal-saas/data-model.md` | Entity relationships, state machines |
| `specs/004-mvp-hardening/spec.md` | Security hardening, access control |
| `specs/004-mvp-hardening/data-model.md` | Bootstrap tokens, ownership validation |

### Business Logic Principles (Quick Reference)

1. **Workspace Lifecycle**: pending -> creating -> running -> stopping -> stopped (see data-model.md)
2. **Lifecycle Control**: Workspaces and nodes are stopped, restarted, or deleted explicitly via API/UI (no automatic idle shutdown)
3. **Ownership Validation**: All workspace operations MUST verify `user_id` matches authenticated user
4. **Bootstrap Tokens**: One-time use, 5-minute expiry, cryptographically random
