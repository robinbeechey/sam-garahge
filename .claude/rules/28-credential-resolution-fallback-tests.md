# Credential Resolution, Fallback, and Rotation Safety Tests

## When This Applies

This rule applies whenever code:

- Looks up a stored credential based on a `(userId, projectId?)` or similar scoping tuple
- Returns one credential by falling back across multiple possible rows (project → user → platform, or similar n-tier)
- Compares a caller-supplied credential against a stored one (OAuth refresh, API key rotation, password change)
- Accepts rotated credentials from an upstream provider (OAuth token refresh, SSO assertions, webhook signatures)

## Why This Rule Exists

PR #753 introduced per-project credential overrides with 3-tier resolution. The initial security review passed because the happy path (project-row-found, no-project-falls-through-to-user) was tested. A post-merge re-audit found 11 additional findings — most severely, a `CodexRefreshLock` stale-token branch that returned the live rotating refresh_token to any same-user caller who submitted a non-matching value.

The class of bug is **silent acceptance at credential trust boundaries.** Every finding was a path where the code accepted something it should have rejected, with no user-visible signal. See the retained incident lesson in this rule.

## Required Behavioral Tests

### 1. Fallback Branch Coverage

For any function that returns a stored credential based on a scoping tuple, there MUST be a behavioral test for EACH of these branches:

| Branch | State | Expected outcome |
|--------|-------|------------------|
| Active scoped row exists | `(userId, projectId)` row found with `is_active=1` | Use the scoped row; do not query higher tiers |
| Scoped row exists but inactive | `(userId, projectId)` row found with `is_active=0` | **Reject the lookup.** Do NOT fall back to higher tier. |
| No scoped row, active user-tier row | No project row; user row exists and active | Fall back to user-tier row |
| No row at any tier | Nothing matches | Return null / reject |

The "inactive scoped row blocks fallback" branch is the most commonly missed and the most dangerous. An inactive row represents an explicit user deactivation; falling back to a higher-tier row silently rotates a credential the user did not intend to rotate.

### 2. Stale-Credential Response Shape

Any function that compares a caller-supplied credential against a stored one MUST have a test asserting that the response on mismatch:

- Does NOT return the stored rotating credential (refresh_token, current API key, session token)
- MAY return a non-rotating short-lived derivative (access_token) if needed for concurrent-caller UX
- Returns enough information that the caller can distinguish "mismatch" from "credential not found"

### 3. Rotation Scope Validation

When accepting rotated credentials from an upstream (OAuth refresh, webhook signature rotation), tests MUST assert:

- The validation defaults to a conservative allowlist when the config env var is unset (not: defaults to disabled)
- An unexpected scope / signature-algorithm / audience causes the request to be REJECTED (502 or equivalent), not merely logged
- Rejected rotations MUST NOT persist the new credential (the old credential remains valid)
- The env-var escape hatch (`EXPECTED_SCOPES=""`) is an explicit opt-out — absent env var ≠ disabled

### 4. Rate Limit on Credential Rotation Endpoints

Credential rotation endpoints (OAuth refresh, key rotation) MUST have:

- A per-principal (userId or workspaceId) rate limit
- The limit state MUST be atomic — DO storage, database row-level locks, or an equivalent. KV read-modify-write is NOT acceptable for rate limits guarding credential rotation.
- A behavioral test that exercises "at-limit rejection" AND "window rollover resets counter"

## Prohibited Patterns

1. **Warn-only rotation validation.** `log.warn('unexpected scope') ; storeNewTokens(...)` silently accepts escalations. Either block or don't validate.

2. **Source-contract tests on credential middleware.** `expect(file.toContain('requireOwnedProject'))` proves code is *present*, not that it *enforces identity*. Rule 02 already bans this — call it out explicitly for auth code.

3. **Tautological IDOR tests.** Mocking `getUserId` to always return the same value and then asserting "cross-user writes rejected" tests "row-not-found handling," not "cross-user identity check." Tests MUST construct scenarios where the DB returns a row whose `userId` does NOT match the caller's.

4. **Defence-in-depth absent.** The query-layer filter (`WHERE userId = ?`) is one line of defence; the middleware MUST also check `row.userId === userId` post-query. An ORM bug, a refactor typo, or a stub in a test harness must not be able to return the wrong row without tripping an assertion.

## Quick Compliance Check

Before merging any PR that touches credential resolution, rotation, or comparison:

- [ ] Every fallback branch has a behavioral test (active-scoped, inactive-scoped, no-scoped, no-row-at-all)
- [ ] Stale/mismatch responses are asserted to OMIT the rotating credential
- [ ] Rotation validation defaults to a conservative allowlist (not disabled)
- [ ] Rotation validation BLOCKS on failure, not warns
- [ ] Rate limit on rotation endpoints uses an atomic primitive (DO storage, DB lock), not KV
- [ ] At least one test returns a mismatched-user row from the DB stub and asserts the middleware still throws 404 (defence-in-depth)
- [ ] No source-contract tests on auth middleware
