# Staging Deployment and Live Verification (Hard Merge Gate)

## Read First: Local-First Development Applies

Before you reach this rule, you should already have exhausted local verification per `.claude/rules/29-local-first-debugging.md`. Staging is the **final integration gate**, not the development environment. If you're about to deploy to staging for the first time, ask yourself: "Have I proven every piece of this locally that CAN be proven locally?" If not, go back.

If staging behavior is wrong, **READ THE LOGS before changing any code** — never guess-and-redeploy. See Rule 29 for the log location matrix (wrangler tail, `/admin/logs`, node `LogsSection`, `journalctl`, `docker logs`).

## This Is a Merge-Blocking Requirement

Every PR that changes code MUST:
1. Deploy successfully to staging (the `Deploy Staging` workflow must be green)
2. Be verified on the live staging app using Playwright and test credentials
3. Confirm that the new feature works AND existing workflows are not broken

**No exceptions. No self-exemptions. No "it's just a small change."** If you write code, you deploy it and test it live before merge.

## Staging vs Production Domains

| Environment | Base Domain | App URL | API URL |
|-------------|-------------|---------|---------|
| **Staging** | `sammy.party` | `https://app.sammy.party` | `https://api.sammy.party` |
| **Production** | `simple-agent-manager.org` | `https://app.simple-agent-manager.org` | `https://api.simple-agent-manager.org` |

**Staging is `sammy.party`, NOT `simple-agent-manager.org`.** When verifying PRs, always test against the staging domain.

## Why This Exists

Local tests run against Miniflare mocks. CI runs unit tests in isolation. Neither environment has real OAuth, real DNS, real D1/KV/DO persistence, or real VM infrastructure. Bugs that only manifest in the real Cloudflare environment have shipped to production repeatedly because agents treated staging verification as optional.

## Step-by-Step Procedure

### All CI Checks Must Pass

All checks — including **SonarCloud Code Analysis** — MUST pass before merge. SonarCloud provides valuable feedback on code quality, duplication, and potential bugs. Treat its findings the same as any other CI failure: investigate, fix, and only merge when green.

GitHub may label some checks as informational, advisory, or not strictly required by branch protection. If the check is red or reports failure, agents must still treat it as a real merge blocker. Failed Preflight Evidence, SonarCloud, lint-adjacent, quality, or evidence checks must be inspected and resolved before merge. Do not summarize them away as "non-blocking" unless the repository explicitly documents that exact check as non-blocking or a human explicitly approves the exception in the PR.

### 1. Staging Deployment Must Be Green

Staging deployment is **manual** — it does NOT run automatically on PRs. You must trigger it yourself:

1. **Check for existing active runs** before triggering:
   ```bash
   gh run list --workflow=deploy-staging.yml --status=in_progress --status=queued --json databaseId,status,createdAt,headBranch
   ```
   If there are active or queued runs, wait at least **5 minutes** from the most recent run's `createdAt` before triggering yours.

2. **Trigger the deployment:**
   ```bash
   gh workflow run deploy-staging.yml --ref <your-branch>
   ```

3. **Watch for completion:**
   ```bash
   sleep 5
   gh run list --workflow=deploy-staging.yml --branch=<your-branch> --limit=1 --json databaseId,status
   gh run watch <run-id>
   ```

If the deployment fails:
- Inspect the deployment logs: `gh run view <RUN_ID> --log-failed`
- **Distinguish code failures from configuration failures:**
  - **Code failure** (build error, type error, test failure): Fix the issue in your branch, push, and re-trigger
  - **Configuration failure** (missing secrets, missing environment variables, permissions errors): **Alert the user immediately.** You cannot fix missing GitHub Environment secrets or Cloudflare configuration. Tell the user exactly what is missing and what action they need to take. Do NOT skip staging verification because of a config failure — do NOT merge without it.
- **Check for pre-existing deploy failures** before assuming your code broke it:
  ```bash
  gh run list --workflow=deploy-staging.yml --limit=5 --json conclusion,createdAt,displayTitle
  ```
  If the last several staging deploys have all failed with the same error, this is a systemic issue — **alert the user** that staging deployments are broken and require intervention. Do not rationalize around it ("my code is fine, it's just a config issue") — a broken staging pipeline is a broken merge gate.
- **A failed staging deployment is the same severity as a failed test — it blocks merge**

### 2. Log In and Verify Using Playwright

After staging deployment succeeds, use Playwright to test the live app:

1. Authenticate using the smoke test token via the token-login API:
   ```typescript
   // In Playwright, use page.request to POST to the token-login endpoint.
   // This sets the session cookie on the browser context automatically.
   const loginResp = await page.request.post('https://api.sammy.party/api/auth/token-login', {
     data: { token: process.env.SAM_PLAYWRIGHT_PRIMARY_USER },
     headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
   });
   // Verify login succeeded (status 200, response has success: true)
   ```
   - The `SAM_PLAYWRIGHT_PRIMARY_USER` env var contains the smoke test token
   - The `SAM_PLAYWRIGHT_*` tokens are staging tokens. They must be exchanged by Playwright against `https://api.sammy.party`, not `SAM_API_URL`.
   - Do not use SAM CLI login as the normal staging verification path. The required flow is browser auth through Playwright, then browser navigation to `https://app.sammy.party`.
   - If the env var is not set, ask the human — do NOT skip this step
2. Navigate to `https://app.sammy.party` (staging) — the session cookie from step 1 authenticates you
3. Verify your changes work as intended (see verification checklists below)
4. Verify existing core workflows still work (see regression checklist below)

### 3. Report Evidence

Include verification evidence in the PR description or as a comment:
- Screenshots from Playwright for UI changes
- API response verification for backend changes
- Console error checks (no new errors in browser console)
- Specific flows tested and their outcomes

## Verification Checklists

### For ALL Code Changes (Regression Check)

Every PR must verify these existing workflows are not broken:

- [ ] App loads without errors at `https://app.sammy.party`
- [ ] Dashboard renders with project cards visible
- [ ] Can navigate to a project page
- [ ] Settings page loads and displays current configuration
- [ ] No new console errors in the browser developer tools
- [ ] API health endpoint responds: `https://api.sammy.party/health`
- [ ] Observability noise check passes: `pnpm quality:observability-noise` (requires `CF_TOKEN`, `CF_ACCOUNT_ID`; optionally `OBSERVABILITY_DB_ID`)

### For UI Changes (Additional)

- [ ] Changed pages/components render correctly
- [ ] Interactive elements respond to clicks, form submissions, navigation
- [ ] Data displays accurately (lists, details, status indicators)
- [ ] Mobile/responsive layout is acceptable
- [ ] No layout breaks on pages adjacent to the changed components

### For API/Backend Changes (Additional)

- [ ] Affected API endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] Data persists and loads correctly through the UI
- [ ] Background processes (DOs, cron jobs) function as expected
- [ ] Error handling returns appropriate responses (not 500s or raw errors)

### For Infrastructure/Agent Changes (Additional)

- [ ] Workspace creation and lifecycle operations work
- [ ] VM agent heartbeats arrive at the control plane
- [ ] WebSocket connections establish and maintain
- [ ] Agent sessions start and communicate correctly

## What "Verify Existing Workflows" Means

It is NOT enough to only test the feature you changed. You must also actively use the product to confirm you haven't broken something else. This means:

1. **Navigate the app** — click through dashboard, projects, settings
2. **Check data loading** — do lists populate? Do details pages show data?
3. **Test interactions** — can you still create things, navigate, use forms?
4. **Watch for errors** — browser console, network failures, blank pages

If you find a bug unrelated to your PR, file it as a backlog task (`tasks/backlog/YYYY-MM-DD-descriptive-name.md`) and continue — but do NOT ignore it.

## Failures Block Merge

- **Staging deployment fails** → fix the deployment, do not merge
- **App doesn't load** → fix the issue, do not merge
- **Your feature doesn't work on staging** → fix the issue, do not merge
- **Existing workflow is broken** → investigate whether your PR caused it; if yes, fix it; if pre-existing, file a backlog task but still do not merge with NEW regressions
- **Cannot authenticate** → check that `SAM_PLAYWRIGHT_PRIMARY_USER` env var is set and that Playwright is posting to `https://api.sammy.party/api/auth/token-login`; if you accidentally use production (`api.simple-agent-manager.org`) the staging token will fail with `401 Invalid token`. If the env var is missing, ask the human — do not skip verification.

## Feature-Specific Verification Is Mandatory (Not Just Page Loads)

Staging verification means **exercising the actual functionality the PR changed**, not just confirming pages render. Checking that the dashboard loads after a provider fix is useless — it proves nothing about whether the fix works.

### What "Verify Your Feature" Actually Means

Match the verification to what the PR actually changes:

| PR Changes | Required Verification |
|------------|----------------------|
| Provider/node creation | Create a node using that provider on staging, confirm it provisions and gets healthy |
| IP allocation/backfill | Create a node, confirm it gets a real IP address, confirm DNS resolves |
| Workspace creation | Create a workspace on a node, confirm it's accessible via `ws-*` subdomain |
| Agent installation | Submit a task with that agent type, confirm the agent installs and runs |
| Chat/messaging | Send messages in a project chat, confirm they persist and display |
| Task execution | Submit a task, confirm it progresses through the lifecycle |
| Auth changes | Log out and log back in, confirm the auth flow works end-to-end |
| API endpoint changes | Call the affected endpoints and verify responses |

### What Is NOT Acceptable as Feature Verification

- Confirming pages load (this is a regression check, not feature verification)
- Checking that navigation works
- Verifying no console errors
- "The code changes look correct"
- "Unit tests pass"
- **For browser-consumed streams (SSE / WebSocket): using `curl` to verify that
  bytes arrive on the wire.** Curl confirms the *byte stream*; only a real
  browser confirms *dispatch* to the client-side handler (`EventSource.onmessage`
  or `WebSocket.onmessage`). A server can emit perfectly valid SSE that the
  browser parses and then silently drops because nothing is listening for the
  specific event name. See
  the retained incident lesson in this rule.

These are baseline regression checks. They do NOT verify that the specific fix or feature works on the live environment.

### If You Cannot Verify the Feature (Credential / Config Blocker)

If the feature genuinely cannot be tested on staging (e.g., requires credentials, secrets, or infrastructure that aren't configured), you MUST:

1. **Do NOT merge.** A feature that cannot be verified cannot ship.
2. **Add a comment on the PR** explaining exactly what is missing (credential name, secret, service) and what needs to be configured.
3. **Notify the human via `request_human_input`** (SAM MCP tool) with a clear description of the blocker and what action is needed.
4. **Label the PR `needs-human-review`** so it is visible in the PR list.
5. **Stop.** The human decides whether to configure the missing piece and retry, or defer the feature.
6. Do NOT substitute page-load checks as if they verify the feature.

"Missing credentials" is never a valid reason to skip feature verification — it means the feature is **untestable**, which means it is **unshippable**. This applies even if the UI renders correctly, API endpoints respond, and unit tests pass.

#### Incident Reference

On 2026-04-26, PR #823 (SAM Agent Phase A) was merged after the agent rationalized: "End-to-end chat requires a configured Anthropic platform credential... the chat would return a graceful error." The agent verified page loads and API responses but never sent a chat message. The feature was completely broken in production (TransformStream deadlock, zero bytes streaming). The correct action was to stop and ask the human to configure the credential.

## Zero Errors During Feature Verification (ABSOLUTE)

When you exercise the feature on staging, **any error is a merge blocker**. This includes:

- API errors (4xx, 5xx) during the feature flow
- Error toasts, error banners, or error states in the UI
- Console errors related to the feature
- "Not configured" or "not available" messages
- The feature silently doing nothing when it should do something

**You do NOT get to decide that an error is "expected" or "not relevant."** If the feature errors when a user tries to use it, the feature is broken. Period.

### Banned Rationalizations

If you catch yourself thinking any of these during staging verification, STOP — you are about to ship broken code:

- "The error is expected because [infrastructure/config/tooling] isn't set up yet" → The feature isn't ready. Don't merge.
- "The config endpoint returns the right value, which is the main change" → The main change is the FEATURE. Verify the feature.
- "This will work once [X] is upgraded/configured separately" → It doesn't work NOW. Don't ship NOW.
- "I verified the components work individually" → Components working individually ≠ feature working end-to-end.

See `.claude/rules/30-never-ship-broken-features.md` for the full anti-rationalization rule and the incident that created it.

## No Self-Exemptions

- "It's just a docs change" → if you changed ANY `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.go`, or other runtime code, you verify
- "It's just a refactor with no behavior change" → prove it by verifying on staging
- "The tests pass" → tests passed for the TLS YAML bug too; staging is the real gate
- "Staging is currently broken by something else" → distinguish your changes from pre-existing issues; your PR must not make it worse
- "This is the fix for the broken staging" → that's the STRONGEST reason to verify — confirm your fix actually works

## PR Template Checkboxes

The PR template includes mandatory staging verification checkboxes. These are not ceremonial — they represent actual verification that was performed:

- `Staging deployment green` — the Deploy Staging workflow passed
- `Live app verified via Playwright` — you logged in and tested
- `Existing workflows confirmed working` — you checked regression items
- `New feature verified on staging` — your specific changes work live
