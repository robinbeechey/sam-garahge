# Quality Gates

## Request Validation (After Every Task)

After completing ANY task, you MUST re-read the user's original request and verify your work fully addresses it.

1. Scroll back to the user's last message that initiated the task
2. Compare what was requested vs. what was delivered
3. Explicitly confirm each requested item was addressed
4. Acknowledge any items that were deferred or handled differently
5. Do NOT mark work as complete until this validation passes

## Blocker Validation (Before Deferring or Stopping)

Before telling the human you cannot continue, you MUST validate that the blocker is real.

1. Identify the exact assumption: missing auth, missing binary, missing dependency, missing file, permission issue, broken remote, unavailable env var, and so on
2. Run the direct verification step in the environment
3. Try the obvious documented recovery step if one exists
4. Only then report the blocker, with the command(s) attempted and the observed result

Untested assumptions are not blockers. "I think this won't work" is not an acceptable stopping condition.

## Feature Testing Requirements

If you build or modify a feature, you MUST add tests that prove it works before calling the task complete.

1. Add unit tests for new and changed logic/components
2. Add integration tests when multiple layers interact (API routes/services/DB, UI + API data loading, auth flows)
3. Add end-to-end tests for user-critical flows when applicable
4. Run relevant test suites and confirm they pass before completion
5. Manual QA alone is NOT sufficient coverage

### Quick Testing Gate

Before marking feature work complete:
- [ ] Unit tests added/updated for all changed behavior
- [ ] Integration tests added where cross-layer behavior exists
- [ ] Capability test verifies complete happy path across system boundaries (see `10-e2e-verification.md`)
- [ ] For cross-boundary features: at least one vertical slice test mocks at each system boundary with realistic state and asserts the end-to-end outcome (see `35-vertical-slice-testing.md`)
- [ ] E2E coverage added or explicitly justified as not applicable
- [ ] Local test run passes for impacted packages
- [ ] CI test checks are expected to pass with the changes
- [ ] Staging deployment succeeded and live app verified via Playwright (see `13-staging-verification.md`)
- [ ] Playwright visual audit passed for all changed UI surfaces — mobile + desktop, overflow asserted (see `.claude/rules/17-ui-visual-testing.md`; required when `apps/web/`, `packages/ui/`, or `packages/terminal/` are modified)

### Test Locations

- Unit tests: `tests/unit/` in each package
- Integration tests: `apps/api/tests/integration/`
- Use Miniflare for Worker integration tests
- Critical paths require >90% coverage

### Prohibited Test Patterns

**Source-contract tests (`readFileSync` + `toContain()`) are NOT valid behavioral tests.** Reading a component's source code as a string and asserting substrings exist proves that code is *present*, not that it *works*. This pattern creates false confidence — tests pass while the feature is broken.

- Any component with user interactions (click handlers, navigation, form submission, state changes) MUST have tests that **render** the component and **simulate** those interactions.
- Source-contract tests may only be used for static configuration or structural verification (e.g., "does this config file export certain keys", "does this theme file define required tokens").
- When reviewing existing tests, if a test file uses `readFileSync` / `readSource` on a component with interactive behavior, flag it for migration to a behavioral test.

### Interactive Element Test Requirement

Every new button, link, form, or interactive element MUST ship with at least one behavioral test that:
1. **Renders** the component (using `render()` from a test framework)
2. **Simulates** the user interaction (click, submit, type, navigate)
3. **Asserts** the user-visible outcome (DOM change, navigation, displayed text)

A test that only checks the element exists in the DOM is insufficient. The test must exercise what happens when the user interacts with it.

### Credential Resolution Test Requirements

For any function that resolves credentials from a `(userId, projectId?)` tuple — or that compares a caller-supplied credential against a stored one — behavioral tests MUST cover every branch of the resolution (active project → active user → platform → null) AND the "inactive project row does NOT fall through" invariant. See `.claude/rules/28-credential-resolution-fallback-tests.md` for the exact required test matrix. Credential-resolution source-contract tests (`readFileSync` + `toContain`) are explicitly prohibited for this class of code.

## Regression Test Requirements (Mandatory for Bug Fixes)

When fixing a bug, you MUST write **two categories of tests**:

### 1. Tests That Prove the Fix Works

Standard tests that verify the new/corrected behavior functions as intended.

### 2. Tests That Would Have Caught the Regression

Ask: "What test, if it existed before the breaking change was introduced, would have failed and alerted us?" Write that test. This is the more important of the two.

- **Trace the regression to its root cause commit.** Understand exactly what change broke the behavior.
- **Write a test that exercises the contract that was violated.** Not just the symptom — the invariant that should always hold.
- **If mocks hid the bug**, the right response is often an integration or E2E test that uses real (or more realistic) dependencies. Shallow unit tests with overly permissive mocks can give false confidence.
- **If the bug was a missing propagation** (value set in A but never forwarded to B), write a test that constructs the real lifecycle (A then B) and asserts the value arrives.
- **If the bug involves streamed UI data that is later reconstructed from durable storage**, write a parity regression test for the persisted representation, not only the live stream. The test MUST include a partial/status-only update event and assert omitted fields do not clear previously visible metadata. See the retained incident lesson in this rule.
- **If the bug involves lifecycle control across a runtime boundary** (agent/session/workspace/node stop, cancel, retry, replacement, suspend, or resume), the regression test MUST assert the runtime command is invoked before accepting the terminal state or dispatching replacement work. Database state changes and successful JSON responses are insufficient; the test must prove the external agent/node/workspace control side effect.
- **If the bug involves shell or process execution lifecycle** (process groups, child processes, cancellation, timeout, or cleanup after command completion), the regression test MUST cover the success path as well as failure/cancellation paths and prove spawned children are not left alive after the tool or command returns.
- **If the bug involves a utility LLM call through a provider-compatible API**, the regression test MUST assert the exact provider payload controls that make the response contract reliable, not just the returned parsed text. For reasoning-capable models, this includes any explicit thinking/reasoning-disable parameters or response-format controls required for the utility to receive text in the field it reads.

### Destructive Cleanup State Gates

When a workflow deletes state, metadata, lock files, Pulumi stacks, or other recovery handles after deleting external resources, the state-deletion step MUST be gated on an explicit successful cleanup output from the preceding deletion step. Do not gate state deletion only on setup or discovery success. A failed external cleanup must leave state intact so the next run can retry or reconcile resources safely.

### Post-Allocation Cleanup Tests

When a workflow allocates a paid or externally visible resource before later setup steps complete, regression tests MUST cover cleanup after each post-allocation failure. The tests must assert the cleanup request targets the allocated resource directly, preserves the original failure as the primary error, tolerates already-deleted resources when the provider contract allows it, and exposes cleanup failures through structured diagnostics without leaking secrets.

### Evaluating Test Realism

Before finalizing tests, ask:
- Do these mocks accurately represent the real system? Would a broken invariant actually cause a test failure here?
- Is there a cross-component boundary that unit tests can't cover? If so, add an integration test.
- Would a developer introducing the original regression have seen a red CI from these tests? If not, the tests aren't defensive enough.

For exported helpers that return canonical domain types, include at least one direct malformed-domain test when the codebase separates structural validation from semantic validation. A resolver, converter, or parser success result must prove the canonical validation helper ran, not just the lower-level schema parser.

## Post-Mortem and Process Fix Requirements (Mandatory for Bug Fixes)

Every PR that fixes a bug MUST include a post-mortem and process improvement. Bug fixes without process fixes only fix the symptom — the class of bug will recur.

### 1. Post-Mortem (task record)

Record the post-mortem in the relevant task record or archive entry, covering:

1. **What broke**: Describe the user-visible failure
2. **Root cause**: Trace to the specific code change that introduced the bug
3. **Timeline**: When was the bug introduced, when was it discovered, what happened in between?
4. **Why it wasn't caught**: Analyze which practices failed — missing tests, wrong test type, insufficient review, missing trace, etc.
5. **Class of bug**: Generalize beyond this specific instance — what *category* of bug is this? (e.g., "state interaction race conditions", "mock-hidden integration failures", "aspirational documentation treated as fact")
6. **Process fix**: What changes to rules, checklists, agent instructions, or review procedures would prevent this *class* of bug in the future?

### 2. Process Fix (in the same PR)

The PR MUST include concrete changes to at least one of:
- `.claude/rules/` — agent guidelines and quality gates
- `.claude/agents/` — reviewer agent instructions
- `.github/pull_request_template.md` — PR checklist items
- `CLAUDE.md` — project-level instructions

The process fix must target the **class of bug**, not just the specific instance. Ask: "What rule, if it existed before this bug was introduced, would have prevented it?"

### 3. PR Description

The PR description must include a "Post-Mortem" section summarizing the root cause, the class of bug, and the process changes made. See the PR template for the required format.

## Pre-Merge PR Review (Required)

Before merging ANY pull request, run a team of skeptical local subagents to review the PR. Each reviewer should be adversarial — their job is to find problems, not confirm the code works.

### Review Team Composition

Run local subagents **in parallel** covering each language and discipline touched by the PR:

| PR touches | Required reviewer agent |
|------------|----------------------|
| **Always (if task-driven)** | `task-completion-validator` — planned vs. actual work, research gaps, unwired UI, missing tests |
| Go code (`packages/vm-agent/`) | `go-specialist` — concurrency, resource leaks, Go idioms |
| TypeScript API (`apps/api/`) | `cloudflare-specialist` — D1, KV, Workers patterns |
| UI code (`apps/web/`, `packages/ui/`) | `ui-ux-specialist` — accessibility, layout, interactions |
| Auth, credentials, tokens | `security-auditor` — credential safety, OWASP, JWT, multi-tenant IAM scope |
| External service integration (OAuth, cloud IAM, WIF) | Manual design review — consumer simulation, static URIs, binding scope (see `19-external-service-integration.md`) |
| Environment variables | `env-validator` — GH_ vs GITHUB_, deployment mapping |
| Documentation changes | `doc-sync-validator` — docs match code reality |
| Business logic, config | `constitution-validator` — no hardcoded values |
| Tests added/changed | `test-engineer` — coverage, realism, TDD compliance |

### What Reviewers Must Check

Each reviewer should:
1. **Read every changed file** in the PR diff
2. **Challenge assumptions** — what could go wrong? What edge cases are missed?
3. **Check test adequacy** — do the tests actually prove the fix/feature works, or are they too shallow?
4. **Verify data flow completeness** — for multi-component changes, trace the primary data path from input to output. Ask: "Does the data actually arrive at its destination?" (see `10-e2e-verification.md`)
5. **Identify missing tests** — what regression test would catch this if it broke again?
6. **Challenge the design, not just the implementation** — ask "should this work this way?" not just "does this code do what was intended?" If the spec is wrong, the code being correct doesn't help. (see the retained incident lesson in this rule)
7. **For external service integrations**: simulate the setup from a self-hoster's perspective. What do they need to register? Are URIs static? Are IAM bindings scoped per-entity? (see `19-external-service-integration.md`)
8. **Flag any concern**, even minor ones — it's cheaper to address them now

### Acting on Review Findings

- Fix ALL issues rated as bugs or correctness problems before merging
- Address style/improvement suggestions unless there's a clear reason to defer
- If a reviewer identifies a missing test category (e.g., "this needs an integration test, not just unit tests"), add it
- Push fixes and re-run reviewers if changes are substantial

## Infrastructure Change Verification (Required)

Changes to **cloud-init templates, VM agent configuration, DNS records, or TLS certificates** affect whether VMs can boot and communicate with the control plane. These changes MUST be verified with actual VM provisioning — unit tests and staging UI checks are NOT sufficient.

### When This Applies

This gate applies when a PR modifies ANY of:
- `packages/cloud-init/` — cloud-init templates or generation logic
- `packages/vm-agent/` — VM agent startup, TLS, heartbeat, or configuration
- DNS record creation/modification in `apps/api/src/services/dns.ts`
- TLS certificate handling (Origin CA, cert paths, key paths)
- VM agent port, protocol, or connectivity configuration
- `scripts/deploy/` changes that affect VM provisioning infrastructure

### Required Steps

1. **Deploy to staging** and provision a real VM (create a workspace)
2. **Verify the VM agent starts** — check that heartbeats arrive at the control plane within 2 minutes of provisioning
3. **Verify workspace accessibility** — confirm the workspace is reachable via its `ws-*` subdomain
4. **If TLS-related**: verify the full TLS handshake succeeds (agent serves valid cert, CF edge accepts it)
5. **Clean up** — delete the test workspace and node after verification

### Failures Block Merge

If VM provisioning fails, heartbeats do not arrive, or the workspace is unreachable, the PR MUST NOT be merged. Fix the issue and re-verify.

### No Self-Exemptions

**Fixing a broken gate does not exempt you from the gate.** If staging is currently broken by the bug you are fixing, you MUST still deploy your fix branch to staging and verify it *fixes* the broken state. "This is the fix for the thing the gate tests" is not a valid N/A rationale — it is the *strongest* reason to run the gate. The TLS YAML fix PR (#322) was merged without infrastructure verification despite modifying `packages/cloud-init/` — the exact scenario this gate exists to prevent.

### Why This Gate Exists

The TLS YAML indentation bug (see the retained incident lesson in this rule) shipped to production because staging verification only checked UI rendering and API responses — nobody provisioned a VM to verify the cloud-init output actually worked. Unit tests used unrealistic 3-line PEM data that survived the broken indentation by coincidence. The fix PR then repeated the same mistake — skipping verification because the agent rationalized that "this is the fix, not a new change."

## Template Output Verification (Required)

When modifying code that generates structured output (YAML, JSON, XML, TOML), tests MUST parse the output in the target format and verify content integrity — not just check string containment.

### Rules

1. **Parse, don't grep.** Tests for template/generation code MUST parse the output using a real parser (`yaml.parse()`, `JSON.parse()`, etc.) and assert on the parsed structure.
2. **Use realistic test data.** If the template embeds multi-line content (PEM certs, SSH keys, config blocks), tests MUST use realistic multi-line data — not 1-3 line stubs that hide indentation/escaping bugs.
3. **Assert round-trip integrity.** For embedded content, verify the full content survives generation intact: `expect(parsed.field).toBe(originalInput)`.
4. **`toContain('BEGIN CERTIFICATE')` is NOT a valid cert test.** This passes even when the cert is truncated to just the header line.

### Why This Rule Exists

String containment tests on structured output create false confidence. The test passes, CI is green, but the output is malformed. This is the class of bug that caused the TLS YAML indentation incident.

## Staging Deployment and Live Verification (Hard Merge Gate)

**Full details in `.claude/rules/13-staging-verification.md`.** Summary of the hard requirements:

1. **Staging deployment MUST be green.** The `Deploy Staging` workflow is manual — you must trigger it via `gh workflow run deploy-staging.yml --ref <branch>`. Check for existing active runs first and wait at least 5 minutes if one is in progress. A failed staging deployment is the same severity as a failed test — it blocks merge.
2. **Live app MUST be verified via Playwright.** After staging deploys, authenticate the Playwright browser context for `app.sammy.party` (staging — NOT `app.simple-agent-manager.org`, which is production) using the smoke/API token in `SAM_PLAYWRIGHT_PRIMARY_USER` env var via `POST https://api.sammy.party/api/auth/token-login` with body `{ "token": "<value>" }`, then navigate and actively test the application in that browser. Do not use `SAM_API_URL` for this token; staging tokens correctly fail against production. See `.claude/rules/13-staging-verification.md` for the full login procedure.
3. **Existing workflows MUST be confirmed working.** Navigate the dashboard, projects, settings. Verify no regressions — pages load, data displays, navigation works, no new console errors.
4. **New feature/fix MUST be verified on staging.** The specific changes in the PR must work correctly on the live staging environment.
5. **Evidence MUST be reported.** Include screenshots, API responses, or Playwright observations in the PR.
6. **For browser-consumed streams (SSE / WebSocket), verification MUST use a real browser, not `curl`.** `curl` can confirm bytes arrive on the wire; only a browser confirms the client actually dispatches them to its handler. See `.claude/rules/13-staging-verification.md` for the full reasoning and the post-mortem that motivated this rule (the retained incident lesson in this rule).

### No Exceptions

- A "small refactor" still deploys and verifies — prove no behavior changed
- A "fix for broken staging" is the STRONGEST reason to verify — confirm the fix works
- "Tests pass" is not sufficient — tests passed for bugs that only manifested in the real environment
- If you cannot authenticate, first confirm `SAM_PLAYWRIGHT_PRIMARY_USER` is set and that Playwright is using `https://api.sammy.party` for token exchange. If the env var is missing, ask the human — do NOT skip verification.

## Post-Push CI Procedure (Required)

After every push, check GitHub Actions runs for the pushed commit/branch. If ANY workflow fails — including the staging deployment — inspect the failing job logs immediately and implement fixes. Push follow-up commits and repeat until all required workflows are green.

For pull requests, keep the PR template filled (including Agent Preflight block and Staging Verification section) so quality gates can pass.

## Post-Merge Production Verification (Required)

After ANY merge to main, the production deployment triggers automatically. You MUST verify the deployed feature works using Playwright against the live app.

1. Wait for the Deploy Production workflow to complete successfully in GitHub Actions.
2. Use Playwright to navigate to `app.simple-agent-manager.org` (production) and test the deployed feature end-to-end.
3. Authenticate using GitHub OAuth credentials at `/workspaces/.tmp/secure/demo-credentials.md` (production uses GitHub OAuth, not smoke test tokens). If the file is missing, ask the human for credentials.
4. If the feature cannot be tested via Playwright, document why and what was verified manually.
5. Report results to the user — do not assume deployment success just because CI passed.
