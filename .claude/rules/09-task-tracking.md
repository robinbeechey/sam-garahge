# Task Tracking System

## When Working on Tasks

1. **Before starting work**: Read the active task file to understand current state
2. **When starting a new task**: Move from `tasks/backlog/` to `tasks/active/`
3. **During work**: Update the task file checklist and notes as you progress
4. **After completing work**: Only move to `tasks/archive/` when the user confirms completion
5. **When creating tasks**: Use `YYYY-MM-DD-descriptive-name.md` naming in `tasks/backlog/`

## Task File Maintenance

- Check off completed items immediately (don't batch)
- Add implementation notes as you discover important context
- Record failures and dead ends so they aren't repeated
- Refer to the task file before each work session to re-orient
- Keep plans detailed enough that you can resume after context loss

## Research Findings Must Become Actionable (Mandatory)

When writing a task file's research/findings section, every finding that identifies a problem or required change MUST result in one of:

1. **A checklist item** in the Implementation Checklist section that addresses it
2. **An explicit deferral** with a backlog task reference (e.g., "Deferred to `tasks/backlog/2026-03-14-fix-xyz.md`")

Findings that exist only in the Research section without a corresponding checklist item or deferral **will be forgotten during implementation**. This is not a theoretical risk — it has caused production bugs. See the retained incident lesson in this rule.

## Task Completion Validation (Mandatory Before Archive)

Before moving ANY task from `tasks/active/` to `tasks/archive/`, you MUST run the `task-completion-validator` agent (`.claude/agents/task-completion-validator/`). This agent performs six cross-reference checks:

| Check | What it catches |
|-------|----------------|
| **A: Research → Checklist** | Research findings that never became checklist items |
| **B: Checklist → Diff** | Checklist items checked off but not actually in the code changes |
| **C: Criteria → Tests** | Acceptance criteria with no test or manual verification |
| **D: UI → Backend** | UI form fields that collect input but never send it to the API |
| **E: Multi-Resource** | Selection functions that pick from a set without a discriminator |
| **F: Vertical Slice** | Cross-boundary features tested only in isolation with empty mocks instead of vertical slice tests with realistic state (see `35-vertical-slice-testing.md`) |

### Validation Rules

- **CRITICAL/HIGH findings block merge.** Fix them in the branch before merging. Filing a backlog task is NOT an acceptable alternative — the validator exists to catch gaps *before* they ship, not to generate follow-up work. The only exception is explicit human approval to defer a specific finding.
- **A validator FAIL means the task is not complete.** Return to implementation. Do NOT proceed to PR creation or merge.
- **Do NOT rationalize gaps.** "It works when I test it manually" is not an answer to "no test covers this acceptance criterion." Either add the test or document the manual verification with evidence.
- **"Fix or defer" is not a real choice.** If you have time to write a backlog task file, you have time to write the test or fix the gap. The backlog escape hatch has been abused in every case where it was used (PR #568, PR #570) — the follow-up tasks add friction and delay but deliver the same work that should have been done in the original PR.

### When to Run

1. **Before archiving** — always, no exceptions
2. **During PR review** — the `/do` workflow dispatches it automatically in Phase 5
3. **On demand** — use the `task-completion-validator` skill when you want to check progress mid-implementation

## Acceptance Criteria Must Be Testable

When writing acceptance criteria, each criterion must be verifiable by at least one of:
- An automated test (unit, integration, or E2E)
- A documented manual verification with evidence (screenshot, API response, log output)

Criteria like "User with both providers can select which provider to use" require **multi-variant test data** — testing with only one provider present does not verify selection logic.

## Dispatching Tasks to Other Agents

When dispatching a task to another agent (via `dispatch_task` or any other mechanism), the task description MUST instruct the receiving agent to execute the work using the `/do` skill. The `/do` skill is the standard end-to-end workflow for implementing tasks — it handles research, planning, implementation, review, staging verification, and PR creation.

### How to Write Dispatch Descriptions

Include an explicit instruction to use `/do` in the task description. Example:

```
Fix the race condition in workspace cleanup.

Execute this task using the /do skill.
```

The receiving agent will then follow the full `/do` workflow: research, task file creation, worktree setup, implementation, quality checks, specialist review, staging deployment, and PR merge.

### Verify Dispatch Succeeded

After calling `dispatch_task`, wait a few seconds and then check the task status (via `get_task_details` or `list_tasks`) to confirm it was properly dispatched and picked up. The dispatch system can occasionally fail silently — catching this early avoids wasted time waiting for work that never started.

Verification must confirm all of:

- The task/session actually started and is not failed, stuck queued, or missing
- The created task title/summary matches the intended work, not a generic or hallucinated title
- The receiving session is using the requested agent/profile/skill, especially `/do` for implementation work
- The task description still contains the critical constraints you intended to pass along, such as "do not merge", "draft PR", required branch, or required profile

If the session failed immediately, never started, launched under the wrong profile, or lost critical constraints, do not wait on it. Re-dispatch with the corrected task/profile or report the dispatch failure with exact status evidence.

If the requested specialist/profile is not available or cannot be observed from the dispatch result, do not assume it worked. Use the cheapest available status/details check, record what is missing, and either re-dispatch with an explicit supported profile or ask for clarification. A generic task running under the platform default is not a substitute for a requested reviewer, specialist, or constrained profile.

When a dispatched task returns, treat its output as usable only after checking that it came from the intended task/profile and respected the original constraints. If the result was produced by the wrong profile, ignored `draft PR`/`do not merge`, dropped the requested branch, or skipped `/do` when required, document the mismatch and do not use it as validation evidence.

### Why This Matters

Without the `/do` instruction, a dispatched agent may skip critical phases like staging verification, specialist review, or proper PR creation. The `/do` workflow enforces all quality gates defined in this project's rules.

## Integration with Other Systems

- Tasks are for smaller work items; larger features use speckit (`/speckit.*` commands)
- Task files can reference spec files if the work relates to a feature spec
- Constitution validation still applies to all work tracked via tasks
