# VM Agent Technical Patterns

## VM Agent Lifecycle Pattern

When the VM agent needs to make critical HTTP calls to the control plane (e.g., `/request-shutdown`):

1. **Make the call BEFORE local shutdown** — `srv.Stop()` tears down the HTTP server, PTY sessions, and idle detector. Network calls after this may fail.
2. **Always use retry logic with backoff** — A single HTTP call is never reliable enough. Use 3 attempts with 5-second delays.
3. **Log response bodies on failure** — Status codes alone are insufficient. Always read and log `resp.Body` on non-2xx responses.
4. **Never rely solely on the VM to clean itself up** — The control plane MUST have a fallback mechanism.

### Systemd Restart Gotchas

- `Restart=always` restarts the service whenever it exits, regardless of `systemctl disable` or `systemctl mask`
- `systemctl disable` only prevents boot-time auto-start, NOT runtime restarts
- `systemctl mask` requires `daemon-reload` to take effect on a running service
- **Solution**: Block forever with `select {}` after requesting shutdown. The VM will be deleted externally.

## Defense-in-Depth for Async Operations

When a remote system (VM) is responsible for triggering its own cleanup:

1. **Primary path**: VM calls `/request-shutdown` directly after detecting idle timeout
2. **Fallback path**: Control plane heartbeat handler checks idle deadline and initiates deletion server-side
3. **Both paths must use the same deletion logic** — reuse `deleteServer()`, `deleteDNSRecord()`, `cleanupWorkspaceDNSRecords()`
4. **Guard against duplicate execution** — Use DB status transitions (`running` -> `stopping`) as a lock.

## Modifying Cloud-Init

1. Edit `packages/cloud-init/src/template.ts`
2. Update variable wiring in `packages/cloud-init/src/generate.ts` when needed
3. Test cloud-init generation through the workspace provisioning flow

### Runcmd Interpreter Contract

Cloud-init executes scalar `runcmd` entries through `/bin/sh`. On SAM's Ubuntu
VM images, that is Dash rather than Bash.

1. Keep scalar `runcmd` entries POSIX-compatible. Use `set -eu`; do not use
   `pipefail`, process substitution, here-strings, Bash arrays, or other
   Bash-only syntax.
2. If a command genuinely requires Bash, invoke `/bin/bash` explicitly or write
   a file with a `#!/bin/bash` shebang and call that file from `runcmd`.
3. Tests for a changed command block must parse the rendered YAML, extract the
   actual `runcmd` entry, and execute it under its declared interpreter with
   harmless stubs for external side effects. String-presence assertions alone do
   not prove the runtime shell contract.

## System Git Config in Devcontainers

When VM-agent bootstrap code needs to write system Git config inside a devcontainer, use the shared `configureSystemGit()` helper (`packages/vm-agent/internal/bootstrap/bootstrap.go:2126`) instead of invoking `git config --system` directly. Both `ensureGitCredentialHelper()` (credential helper setup) and `ensureGitIdentity()` (user.email / user.name) already route through this helper.

Direct `git config --system` calls can fail provisioning when `/etc/gitconfig.lock` is left behind by a concurrent or interrupted config write (`isGitConfigLockError()` at `bootstrap.go:2205` detects this). The shared helper retries with backoff, checks for an active `git config` process before treating the lock as stale, and removes the lock only when safe. See the retained incident lesson in this rule.
