## What You Get

**Agents in parallel, each in a real environment.** Every agent runs in its own isolated Docker container on a VM you own — full Linux, Docker, and git, reachable from any browser. Run a handful or hundreds at once, each in a clean workspace.

**Bring your own cloud.** VMs are provisioned in your own Hetzner, Scaleway, or GCP account and billed directly to you. SAM never stores your cloud provider credentials as platform env vars — they're encrypted per-user. Your agents, your infra, your data.

**Bring your own agent.** Six harnesses work today: [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code), Codex, Gemini, Mistral, OpenCode, and Amp. Use your own API key, your OAuth/subscription token, or the platform proxy.

**Chat-first, and it outlives workspaces.** Link a GitHub repo, describe a task in natural language, and watch every tool call stream back. Conversations persist at the project level — stop a workspace, spin up a new one weeks later, and your full history is still there.

**Serverless control plane.** Self-hosted on Cloudflare ($5/mo Workers Paid plan) — the control plane provisions, schedules, and tears down workspaces with nothing to babysit. A workspace costs ~$0.007–0.03/hr compared to $0.18–0.36/hr on GitHub Codespaces.

## How It Works

```
You: "Add rate limiting to the /api/upload endpoint"
         |
    Project Chat (app.{domain})
         |
    Cloudflare Worker API
         |
    TaskRunner -- alarm-driven orchestrator that:
      1. Claims a warm node or provisions a new VM in your cloud
      2. Creates a Docker workspace with your repo
      3. Starts your chosen agent with the task description
      4. Streams agent output back to project chat
         |
    Agent streams results back as it works
```

## Architecture

| **Real-time data** | Chat messages, activity, sessions | Durable Objects with embedded SQLite (per project)                                                                         |
| **Compute**        | Workspaces running coding agents  | VMs in your own cloud (Hetzner, Scaleway, or GCP) with a Go agent managing Docker containers, WebSocket terminal, and auth |
| **Warm pool**      | Fast workspace starts             | Completed VMs stay warm for 30 min for instant reuse                                                                       |

The control plane is serverless — no servers to manage, no databases to back up. Compute scales to zero when you're not using it.

## Quick Deploy

SAM deploys automatically via GitHub Actions. Fork, configure, push. For the complete setup guide with detailed steps and troubleshooting, see the **[Self-Hosting Guide](https://simple-agent-manager.org/docs/guides/self-hosting/)**.

### Prerequisites

- A [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up) (Workers Paid plan, $5/mo)
- A domain with nameservers pointing to Cloudflare
- A [GitHub App](https://simple-agent-manager.org/docs/guides/self-hosting/#github-setup) for OAuth + repo access

### Steps

1. **Fork this repository**
2. **Create a GitHub Environment** named `production` in your fork's Settings > Environments
3. **Add the required secrets** (Cloudflare API token, GitHub App credentials, etc. — see the [Self-Hosting Guide](https://simple-agent-manager.org/docs/guides/self-hosting/) for the full list)
4. **Push to `main`** — GitHub Actions provisions all infrastructure, deploys the API + UI, runs migrations, and verifies health

Your instance is live at `app.{your-domain}`. Users sign in with GitHub and provide their own cloud provider API token (Hetzner, Scaleway, or GCP) to create workspaces.

## Development

```bash
pnpm install        # Install dependencies
pnpm build          # Build all packages
pnpm test           # Run tests
pnpm typecheck      # Type check
pnpm lint           # Lint
pnpm format         # Format
```

Build packages in dependency order: `shared` > `providers` > `cloud-init` > `api` / `web`.
