description: How SAM handles authentication, encryption, and credential management.

SAM's security model separates **platform secrets** (managed by operators) from **user credentials** (encrypted per-user in the database).

## Credential Types

### Platform Secrets

These are Cloudflare Worker secrets set during deployment:

| Secret                    | Purpose                                                                                  |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ENCRYPTION_KEY`          | AES-256-GCM key for encrypting user credentials                                          |
| `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY`         | RSA-2048 key for signing workspace and callback tokens                                   |
| `JWT_PUBLIC_KEY`          | RSA-2048 key for token verification (exposed via JWKS)                                   |
| `CF_API_TOKEN`            | Cloudflare deploy, DNS, Origin CA certificate issuance, observability, and AI Gateway operations (requires Account → SSL and Certificates → Edit)  |

Security keys are automatically generated and persisted by Pulumi on first deployment. Cloudflare secrets remain Worker secrets because they are deployment trust roots. GitHub App/OAuth, GitHub webhook, Google OAuth, and GitLab OAuth credentials can be supplied either as optional environment fallbacks or through the first-run/superadmin platform config UI; runtime values are stored encrypted in D1 and override environment fallbacks. They never appear in source control.

### Platform Integration Credentials

Admin-managed integration secrets stored encrypted in D1:

| Credential                | Purpose                                  | Resolution order                 |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| GitHub OAuth client secret | GitHub sign-in and OAuth refresh         | Runtime D1 → Worker env → unset  |
| GitHub App private key     | Installation tokens for repository access | Runtime D1 → Worker env → unset  |
| GitHub webhook secret      | GitHub App webhook HMAC verification     | Runtime D1 → Worker env → unset  |
| Google login OAuth client secret | Google sign-in (BetterAuth social login) | Runtime D1 → Worker env (`GOOGLE_LOGIN_CLIENT_SECRET`) → unset |
| GitLab OAuth client secret | GitLab sign-in and repository access | Runtime D1 → Worker env (`GITLAB_CLIENT_SECRET`) → unset |
| Google infra OAuth client secret | GCP deployment authorization flows (separate client from login) | Worker env (`GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`) → unset |

### User Credentials

User-provided secrets stored encrypted in D1:

| Credential         | Purpose                      | Encryption                     |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Hetzner API token  | VM provisioning              | AES-256-GCM, per-credential IV |
| Agent API keys     | Claude/OpenAI API access     | AES-256-GCM, per-credential IV |
| Agent OAuth tokens | Claude Pro/Max subscriptions | AES-256-GCM, per-credential IV |

User credentials are **never** stored as environment variables or Worker secrets.

## Authentication Flow

SAM uses **BetterAuth** with configured OAuth login providers for user authentication:

1. User clicks a configured sign-in provider such as GitHub, Google, or GitLab
2. API redirects to that provider's OAuth flow
3. The provider returns an authorization code
4. API exchanges code for access token
5. API fetches user profile and email
6. BetterAuth creates/updates user record and session
7. Session cookie set in browser

### Token Types

| Token           | Lifetime  | Purpose                          | Validated By            |
| --------------- | --------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Session cookie  | Hours     | Browser authentication           | API Worker (BetterAuth) |
| Workspace JWT   | Minutes   | Terminal WebSocket auth          | VM Agent (via JWKS)     |
| Bootstrap token | 5 minutes | One-time VM credential injection | API Worker              |
| Callback token  | Minutes   | VM Agent → API callbacks         | API Worker              |

## Credential Encryption

User credentials are encrypted at rest using **AES-256-GCM**:

```
Encrypt: plaintext + ENCRYPTION_KEY → { ciphertext, iv }  (stored in D1)
Decrypt: { ciphertext, iv } + ENCRYPTION_KEY → plaintext   (on-demand)
```

Each credential gets a random initialization vector (IV), ensuring identical plaintext values produce different ciphertext.

## Terminal Authentication

Terminal WebSocket connections use short-lived JWTs:

1. Browser requests a terminal token: `POST /api/terminal/token`
2. API signs a JWT with the workspace ID and user ID
3. Browser connects: `wss://ws-{id}.domain/workspaces/{id}/shell?token=...`
4. Worker proxies the WebSocket to the VM Agent
5. VM Agent validates the JWT against the API's JWKS endpoint (`/.well-known/jwks.json`)

## Bootstrap Security

When a new VM starts, it needs credentials (callback URL, node ID) but **no secrets are embedded in cloud-init**:

1. API creates a one-time bootstrap token (cryptographically random, 5-minute expiry)
2. Cloud-init script includes only the token and API URL
3. VM Agent redeems the token: `POST /api/bootstrap/{token}`
4. API returns the full configuration (callback URL, node ID, etc.)
5. Token is invalidated after use

## VM TLS Certificates

New nodes use per-node Origin CA key material rather than a platform-shared private key:

1. The API Worker passes a node-scoped certificate endpoint into cloud-init (`apps/api/src/services/nodes.ts`).
2. Cloud-init generates `/etc/sam/tls/origin-ca-key.pem` locally on the VM, creates a CSR, and posts only that CSR to `POST /api/nodes/:id/origin-ca-certificate` with the node callback JWT (`packages/cloud-init/src/template.ts`).
3. The API Worker verifies the callback token is node-scoped and matches `:id`, then signs the CSR through Cloudflare Origin CA using `CF_API_TOKEN` (`apps/api/src/routes/node-lifecycle.ts`, `apps/api/src/services/origin-ca-certificates.ts`).
4. The VM stores the returned certificate at `/etc/sam/tls/origin-ca.pem` and starts the VM agent with `TLS_CERT_PATH` and `TLS_KEY_PATH`.

The certificate hostnames remain wildcard-scoped (`*.BASE_DOMAIN`, `*.vm.BASE_DOMAIN`, and `BASE_DOMAIN`) so existing `ws-*` and `{node}.vm` routing continues to work. The private key is no longer shared across nodes or embedded in static cloud-init user-data. Each node receives a distinct private key and short-lived certificate, with `ORIGIN_CA_CERT_VALIDITY_DAYS` defaulting to 7 days.

### Legacy Origin CA Rotation

Deployments created before the per-node CSR model may have running nodes that still hold a broadly distributed wildcard `ORIGIN_CA_KEY`. Rotate that legacy material by draining or deleting old nodes, deploying the per-node certificate model, revoking the old wildcard Origin CA certificate in Cloudflare SSL/TLS → Origin Server, and removing any manually configured `ORIGIN_CA_CERT`/`ORIGIN_CA_KEY` Worker secrets. New nodes do not require those Worker secrets.

## Security Best Practices

- **Rotate keys quarterly** — regenerate JWT and encryption keys
- **Minimal GitHub App permissions** — only Contents (read/write), Metadata (read-only), and Email addresses (read-only)
- **HTTPS everywhere** — all traffic encrypted via Cloudflare
- **Session isolation** — each workspace JWT is scoped to a specific workspace ID
- **No shared cloud credentials** — BYOC model means the platform has no Hetzner access

:::caution
Rotating the `ENCRYPTION_KEY` will make existing encrypted credentials unreadable. Users will need to re-enter their Hetzner tokens and API keys after key rotation.
