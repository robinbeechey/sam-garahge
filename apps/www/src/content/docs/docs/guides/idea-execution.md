title: Idea Execution
description: How ideas go from description to pull request — execution lifecycle, agent dispatch, and warm node pooling.

Ideas are the primary way to use SAM for autonomous AI coding work. You describe what you want done in the chat, and SAM handles provisioning, agent execution, and cleanup.

## Executing an Idea

You execute ideas through the **project chat interface**. Type your description in the chat input and submit. SAM will:

1. **Generate a title** — AI-powered title generation using Workers AI (short messages are used as-is)
2. **Create a branch** — descriptive branch name with `sam/` prefix
3. **Select a node** — reuses a warm node if available, otherwise provisions a new one
4. **Create a workspace** — clones your repo and sets up the environment
5. **Start the agent** — runs your configured agent (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Mistral Vibe, OpenCode, or Amp) with your description
6. **Stream output** — watch the agent work in real-time through the chat interface

### Execution Options

When executing an idea, you can optionally specify:

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **VM Size** | small, medium, or large | Project default |
| **Provider** | Hetzner, Scaleway, or GCP | Project default provider |
| **Agent Type** | Which AI agent to use | Project default agent |
| **Workspace Profile** | `full` or `lightweight` | `full` |
| **Node** | Reuse a specific existing node | Auto-select |

## Idea Lifecycle

Ideas progress through these stages as seen in the UI:

| Stage | What's happening |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Exploring** | You're brainstorming — the idea is a draft |
| **Ready** | The idea is defined and ready to execute |
| **Executing** | An agent is actively working on it |
| **Done** | The agent finished and created a PR |
| **Parked** | The idea was cancelled or execution failed |

### Execution Steps

While an idea is executing, SAM tracks detailed progress:

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `node_selection` | Finding or provisioning a node |
| `node_provisioning` | Waiting for the VM to boot |
| `node_agent_ready` | Waiting for the VM Agent to report ready |
| `workspace_creation` | Creating the Docker container and cloning the repo |
| `workspace_ready` | Waiting for the devcontainer to finish building |
| `agent_session` | Starting the AI agent session |
| `running` | Agent is actively working |

### What Happens When Execution Completes

When an agent finishes its work:

1. The agent commits and pushes changes to the branch
2. A pull request is created automatically
3. A notification is sent
4. The workspace is stopped
5. If the node was auto-provisioned and has no other active workspaces, it enters the **warm pool** for potential reuse

## AI Title Generation

SAM automatically generates concise titles for ideas using Workers AI:

- Messages **at or below 100 characters** are used as the title directly (no AI needed)
- Longer messages are summarized by a Workers AI model (default: `@cf/google/gemma-4-26b-a4b-it`)
- If AI generation fails or times out, the message is truncated to 100 characters as a fallback
- Generation uses exponential backoff with up to 2 retries

Configure via environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `TASK_TITLE_MODEL` | `@cf/google/gemma-4-26b-a4b-it` | Workers AI model for title generation |
| `TASK_TITLE_GENERATION_ENABLED` | `true` | Set `false` to always use truncation |
| `TASK_TITLE_TIMEOUT_MS` | `5000` | Per-attempt timeout |
| `TASK_TITLE_SHORT_MESSAGE_THRESHOLD` | `100` | Messages at or below this length bypass AI |

## Agent-to-Agent Dispatch

Running agents can spawn follow-up work within the same project using MCP tools. This enables multi-step workflows where one agent delegates sub-work to others.

### How It Works

An agent running inside a workspace has access to MCP tools that provide project awareness:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `dispatch_task` | Spawn a new idea for execution |
| `create_idea` | Create a new idea |
| `update_idea` | Update an idea's title, content, priority, or status |
| `list_ideas` | View existing ideas |
| `get_idea` | Read idea details |
| `search_ideas` | Search ideas by keyword |
| `update_task_status` | Report progress |
| `complete_task` | Mark the current work as done |
| `request_human_input` | Ask the user for a decision |

### Dispatch Limits

To prevent runaway recursion, dispatch has configurable limits:

| Limit | Default | Env Variable |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| Max recursion depth | 3 | `MCP_DISPATCH_MAX_DEPTH` |
| Max dispatched per parent | 5 | `MCP_DISPATCH_MAX_PER_TASK` |
| Max active dispatched per project | 10 | `MCP_DISPATCH_MAX_ACTIVE_PER_PROJECT` |

### Example Flow

```
You submit: "Refactor the auth module and add tests"
  │
  ├── Agent 1 starts working on refactoring
  │     ├── dispatch_task("Write unit tests for new auth service")
  │     │     └── Agent 2 writes tests in parallel
  │     └── dispatch_task("Update API docs for auth changes")
  │           └── Agent 3 updates documentation
  │
  └── All agents commit, push, and create PRs
```

## Warm Node Pooling

After an idea finishes executing, the auto-provisioned node enters a **warm** state instead of being destroyed immediately. This dramatically reduces startup time for follow-up work.

### How It Works

1. Execution completes → workspace is stopped
2. If the node has no other active workspaces, it enters the warm pool
3. The `NodeLifecycle` Durable Object schedules a cleanup alarm
4. If new work arrives before the timeout, the warm node is reused (seconds vs. minutes)
5. After the timeout expires, the node is destroyed

### Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `NODE_WARM_TIMEOUT_MS` | `1800000` (30 min) | How long warm nodes stay alive |
| `MAX_AUTO_NODE_LIFETIME_MS` | `14400000` (4 hr) | Absolute max lifetime for auto-provisioned nodes |
| `NODE_WARM_GRACE_PERIOD_MS` | `2100000` (35 min) | Cron sweep grace period |

### Orphan Protection

SAM uses three layers of defense to prevent orphaned VMs from running indefinitely:

1. **Durable Object alarm** — primary cleanup mechanism
2. **Cron sweep** — catches nodes that miss their DO alarm (every 5 minutes)
3. **Max lifetime** — absolute 4-hour limit regardless of warm state
