---

SAM's project pages are chat-first interfaces where you interact with AI coding agents in real-time.

Recent chat updates make the workspace feel more like a persistent work surface: task-backed chats can be forked consistently, SAM-injected setup context is collapsed out of the main conversation, and desktop sidebars can be collapsed when you need more room.

## Real-Time Streaming

Agent output streams directly to your browser via WebSocket. You see code being written, terminal commands executing, and the agent's thought process as it happens — no waiting for a complete response.

## File Browsing

While chatting with an agent, you can browse the workspace's file system directly from the chat panel — no need to switch to a terminal.

### How to Use

- Open the file browser panel to navigate the file tree and view files
- View git status and diffs to see what the agent changed
- Click file references in tool-call cards to jump directly to that file

### What You Can Do

| Action         | Description                                        |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Browse**     | Navigate directories and view the full file tree   |
| **View**       | Read any file with syntax highlighting             |
| **Diff**       | View git diffs for changed files                   |
| **Git status** | See which files are modified, staged, or untracked |

## File Upload and Download

You can attach files to your chat messages and download files from workspace containers.

### Uploading Files

Click the **paperclip** button in the chat input to attach files. Files are uploaded to the workspace container's `.private` directory.

**Limits:**

- Maximum per-file size: 50 MB (configurable via `FILE_UPLOAD_MAX_BYTES`)
- Maximum batch size: 250 MB (configurable via `FILE_UPLOAD_BATCH_MAX_BYTES`)
- Filenames must not contain shell metacharacters

### Downloading Files

Click the **download** button on files shown in the file browser panel to download them from the workspace container.

## Image Viewer

When browsing files, images are rendered inline with a dedicated viewer:

- **Small images** (under 10 MB) load inline automatically
- **Medium images** (10–50 MB) show a click-to-load preview
- **Large images** (over 50 MB) offer a download link only
- Toggle between **fit-to-panel** and **1:1** zoom modes

Supported formats include PNG, JPG, GIF, SVG, WebP, and other common image types.

## Document Cards

When an agent adds a file to the project library or surfaces an existing one, the
chat renders a rich **document card** in the timeline instead of a plain tool
row. Cards appear for three agent tools:

- `upload_to_library` — the agent saved a new document (e.g. a written
  explanation or report) to the library.
- `replace_library_file` — the agent updated an existing library document.
- `display_from_library` — the agent pointed at a document that already exists,
  optionally with a short caption explaining why it's relevant.

Each card shows a tiered inline preview based on the file type:

- **Images** render as an inline thumbnail.
- **Markdown** shows a clamped source preview with a fade.
- **PDFs and other types** show an icon with the file name and size.

Click a card to open the document full-screen. Because library files are stored
durably, document cards keep working after the workspace is gone — a card whose
file was later deleted degrades to a "no longer in the library" note rather than
breaking.

## Voice Input

Click the microphone button to speak your message instead of typing. SAM transcribes your audio using OpenAI Whisper (via Cloudflare Workers AI).

**Limits:**

- Maximum audio file size: 10 MB

## Text-to-Speech Playback

Agent responses can be played back as audio. SAM uses Deepgram Aura 2 (via Workers AI) for natural-sounding speech synthesis.

- Audio is generated on-demand and cached in R2 for subsequent playback
- Configurable voice: `luna` by default (via `TTS_SPEAKER`)
- Maximum text length: 100,000 characters per synthesis
- Output format: MP3
- **Persistent player** — audio continues playing as you navigate between pages

### TTS Configuration

| Variable              | Default                  | Description                  |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| `TTS_ENABLED`         | `true`                   | Enable/disable TTS           |
| `TTS_MODEL`           | `@cf/deepgram/aura-2-en` | Workers AI TTS model         |
| `TTS_SPEAKER`         | `luna`                   | Voice selection              |
| `TTS_ENCODING`        | `mp3`                    | Audio encoding format        |
| `TTS_MAX_TEXT_LENGTH` | `100000`                 | Max characters per synthesis |
| `TTS_TIMEOUT_MS`      | `60000`                  | Synthesis timeout            |

## Conversation Forking

You can branch off from any point in a conversation to explore an alternative approach without losing the original thread.

Forking now applies to task-backed chat sessions broadly, including instant-container and conversation-style sessions. You do not need to know whether the original session started from an idea, a task, or a lightweight chat; if the session is forkable, SAM preserves the lineage and starts the new branch with the right context.

### How to Fork

1. Hover over a message in the chat history
2. Click the **Fork** button
3. SAM generates an AI-powered context summary of the conversation up to that point
4. A new session starts with awareness of the previous conversation

### Context Summarization

When forking, SAM uses Workers AI to generate a concise summary of the conversation so far. This summary is injected as a system message in the new session.

For short conversations (5 or fewer messages), the messages are passed directly without AI summarization. For longer conversations, a model generates a focused summary.

| Variable                          | Default                         | Description                          |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `CONTEXT_SUMMARY_MODEL`           | `@cf/google/gemma-4-26b-a4b-it` | Model for context summarization      |
| `CONTEXT_SUMMARY_MAX_LENGTH`      | `4000`                          | Max summary length (characters)      |
| `CONTEXT_SUMMARY_TIMEOUT_MS`      | `10000`                         | Summarization timeout                |
| `CONTEXT_SUMMARY_MAX_MESSAGES`    | `50`                            | Max messages to include              |
| `CONTEXT_SUMMARY_SHORT_THRESHOLD` | `5`                             | Skip AI for conversations this short |

### Fork Limits

- Maximum fork depth: 10 levels (configurable via `ACP_SESSION_MAX_FORK_DEPTH`)
- Each fork creates a new session with its own branch and workspace

## Full-Text Search

SAM indexes chat messages for full-text search. When a session ends, streaming tokens are grouped into logical messages and indexed using FTS5.

- **Completed sessions**: Full-text search with stemming and phrase matching
- **Active sessions**: Keyword-based fallback search

Agents can search messages using the `search_messages` MCP tool.

## Session Lifecycle

Agent conversations and task sessions stay active until they complete, fail, or are explicitly stopped.

SAM also collapses platform-injected setup messages in the chat timeline. Those messages contain project instructions, task context, and policy that the agent received before it started. They remain available for debugging, but they no longer dominate the visible conversation.

## Starting a New Chat

When you open a new chat, SAM offers a few repo-aware **starter prompts** (for example, "What's in this repo?" or "Run the tests and fix any failures") so you can get moving without a blank page. Pick one or type your own.

To send on a desktop keyboard, press **Cmd+Enter** on Mac or **Ctrl+Enter** on Windows/Linux — plain **Enter** inserts a new line so you can write multi-line prompts. The composer shows the correct shortcut for your platform as a hint. On mobile, tap the send button; **Enter** always inserts a new line.

## Session Filters (Shared Projects)

In a project shared with teammates, everyone's chat sessions appear in the same session list. A filter near the session search lets you switch between **my sessions** and **all sessions** so you can focus on your own work or see everything happening in the project.

For the full team workflow — inviting people, approving access, roles, and shared resources — see [Collaboration & Shared Projects](/docs/guides/collaboration/).

## Focus Mode

On desktop, project chat has three layout levels you can cycle with the **F** key (or the toggle at the bottom of the sidebar):

- **Default** — full navigation and session sidebars.
- **Focus** — collapses the main navigation so you stay inside one project.
- **Zen** — collapses the session sidebar too, for maximum reading and prompt-writing space.

Reopen the sidebars whenever you need to switch projects, sessions, or settings.

## Command Palette

Press **Cmd+K** (Mac) or **Ctrl+K** (Windows/Linux) to open the global command palette. This provides quick navigation across the app:

- Search and jump to projects
- Navigate to settings, dashboard, or other pages
- Access workspace actions
- Available on both desktop and mobile (via the workspace action menu)
