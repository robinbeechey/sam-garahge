-- Canonical GitHub App installation account state.

-- `github_installations` remains the per-user SAM linkage table. Shared
-- organization discovery must not depend on those per-user rows because user
-- unlink/account deletion may remove them. This table is keyed by GitHub's
-- external installation id and is removed/tombstoned only when GitHub sends an
-- installation.deleted webhook.
