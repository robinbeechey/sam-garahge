argument-hint: <task description>

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You are an autonomous task executor. The user has described a task above. Your job is to take it from idea to merged PR with zero hand-holding. Follow every phase below in order.

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: State Persistence (Read This First)

Long workflows lose context to compaction. You MUST maintain a `.do-state.md` file (gitignored) as external memory. **This is non-negotiable.** See `.claude/rules/14-do-workflow-persistence.md` for the full spec.

**Before EVERY phase:**
1. Re-read `.do-state.md` (create it if it doesn't exist — see rule 14)
2. Re-read the task file to confirm what's done and what remains
3. Update the state file with your current phase and progress

**If your context feels incomplete or you're unsure where you are:** STOP. Read `.do-state.md` and the task file. They are your source of truth, not your memory of the conversation.

**At the Phase 3 → Phase 4 boundary:** Enter Plan Mode briefly. Re-read the state file, re-read the task file, and verify every checklist item is genuinely complete before proceeding. This checkpoint prevents the "rush to PR" failure mode.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Verify Assumptions Before Reporting Blockers

Do not tell the human you are blocked because of an untested assumption about the environment.

Before reporting that you cannot proceed, you MUST:

1. Name the suspected blocker clearly
2. Run the cheapest direct verification step available
3. Try the obvious repo-documented recovery step when one exists
4. Report the exact command(s) tried and the observed result

Examples:
- If you think GitHub access is unavailable, run `gh auth status`
- If tests fail because a workspace package cannot be resolved, follow the documented build order before declaring validation blocked
- If a binary seems missing, verify whether dependencies simply have not been installed yet

Statements like "it probably won't work" or "credentials seem unavailable" are not acceptable blocker evidence.

---

## Phase 1: Research & Task Creation

1. **Understand the request.** Parse the user input to identify:
   - What needs to change (feature, bug fix, refactor, etc.)
   - Which parts of the codebase are likely affected
   - Any constraints or preferences stated
   - Whether the user explicitly requested `draft PR`, `do not merge`, `WIP`, `prototype`, `spike`, `demo`, `show me first`, or equivalent handling

   If the request says `draft PR`, `do not merge`, `prepare but don't merge`, or equivalent, record that constraint in the task file and `.do-state.md`. `/do` must stop after creating or updating the draft PR and must not mark it ready or merge without a later explicit user instruction.

   If the request is for prototype, spike, or demo work, treat prototype artifacts as non-production by default. Do not add production-routed prototype pages, demo-only navigation, fixture-backed UI, or scaffolded experimental routes unless the user explicitly asks to ship the prototype itself. If the user asks to apply prototype learnings to the real UI, the real product surface is the deliverable.

2. **Research the codebase.** Before writing anything:
   - Search and read to find all relevant code paths
   - Read related public docs in `apps/www/src/content/docs/docs/`, plus `specs/` and `.claude/rules/`
   - **Review relevant post-mortems** in the incident lessons retained in `.claude/rules/` and relevant `tasks/archive/` records. Search for post-mortems that touch the same subsystems, patterns, or failure modes as your task. Read at least the "What broke", "Root cause", and "Process fix" sections. These contain hard-won lessons about what goes wrong in this codebase — ignoring them risks repeating the exact same mistakes. If your task involves staging verification, credential handling, data flow across boundaries, or UI-to-backend paths, there is almost certainly a relevant post-mortem.
   - Use web search for external library/API docs if needed
   - Identify existing patterns, conventions, and test approaches in the affected areas

   If the user explicitly asks for local subagents to critique proposed changes before implementation, do that after research and before file edits. Send the concrete proposal to bounded local reviewer agents, wait for their critique, reconcile disagreements, and record the consensus or remaining dissent in the task file or `.do-state.md` before implementing.

3. **Create a task file** in `tasks/backlog/` using the format `YYYY-MM-DD-descriptive-name.md`:
   - Problem statement (what and why)
   - Research findings (key files, patterns, dependencies discovered)
   - Detailed checklist of implementation steps
   - Acceptance criteria
   - References to relevant docs, specs, or rules

4. **Commit and push the task file directly to `main`:**
   ```
   git add tasks/backlog/<file>.md
   git commit -m "task: add <descriptive-name>"
   git push origin main
   ```

5. **Create `.do-state.md`** in the repo root with the task summary, task file path, and phase checklist. Check off Phase 1.

> **IMPORTANT**: Only the task file goes to main. All implementation work goes on a feature branch.

---

## Phase 2: Worktree Setup

> **Checkpoint**: Re-read `.do-state.md`. Confirm Phase 1 is complete. Update "Current Phase" to Phase 2.

1. **Create a feature branch and worktree:**
   ```
   git worktree add ../sam-<short-name> -b <branch-name>
   ```
   - Branch naming: use a descriptive kebab-case name
   - Worktree location: `../sam-<short-name>` (sibling to the main repo directory)

2. **Move the task file** from `tasks/backlog/` to `tasks/active/` in the worktree and commit.

3. **Install dependencies** in the worktree:
   ```
   cd ../sam-<short-name> && pnpm install
   ```

4. **Verify the starting state** — run `pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint` to confirm a clean baseline.

5. **Update `.do-state.md`** with the branch name and worktree path. Check off Phase 2.

---

## Phase 3: Implementation

> **Checkpoint**: Re-read `.do-state.md` and the task file. Confirm Phases 1-2 are complete. Update "Current Phase" to Phase 3. Copy the implementation checklist into the state file's "Implementation Progress" section.

Execute the checklist from the task file. Follow these rules:

1. **Work through checklist items sequentially**, checking each off in the task file as you complete it.

2. **Follow project conventions:**
   - Obey all rules in `.claude/rules/`
   - Respect build order: `shared` -> `providers` -> `cloud-init` -> `api` / `web`
   - Update documentation in the same commit as code changes
   - Write tests that prove the feature works
   - For features crossing system boundaries: write at least one vertical slice test that mocks at each boundary with realistic state (see `.claude/rules/35-vertical-slice-testing.md`)
   - No hardcoded values (constitution Principle XI)

3. **Push frequently.** After every meaningful unit of work:
   ```
   git add <specific-files>
   git commit -m "<type>: <description>"
   git push origin <branch-name>
   ```

4. **Run quality checks regularly** during implementation:
   - `pnpm typecheck` after type-related changes
   - `pnpm lint` after any code changes
   - `pnpm test` after adding/modifying tests

5. **Playwright visual audit (MANDATORY for UI changes).** If this PR touches any files in `apps/web/`, `packages/ui/`, or `packages/terminal/`, you MUST run a local Playwright visual audit before proceeding to Phase 4. See `.claude/rules/17-ui-visual-testing.md` for full requirements.

   **What to do:**
   1. Write (or run existing) Playwright audit tests for every changed UI surface
   2. Use mock data covering: normal data, long text (200+ char titles), empty states, many items (30+), error states, and special characters (unicode, emoji, HTML entities)
   3. Capture screenshots at both mobile (375x667) and desktop (1280x800) viewports
   4. Store screenshots in `.codex/tmp/playwright-screenshots/` with descriptive names
   5. Visually inspect every screenshot for:
      - No horizontal overflow (assert `scrollWidth <= innerWidth`)
      - No content clipping or off-screen elements
      - Proper text wrapping with long content
      - Consistent spacing and typography
      - Touch targets ≥44px on mobile
   6. Fix any issues found before continuing

   **Run from `apps/web/`:**
   ```bash
   npx playwright test --project="iPhone SE (375x667)" --project="Desktop (1280x800)"
   ```

   **If no audit test exists** for a changed component, write one following the pattern in `apps/web/tests/playwright/ideas-ui-audit.spec.ts`. Every new or significantly modified UI surface needs its own audit spec.

   **Failures block Phase 4.** Do not proceed until all visual issues are resolved.

6. **Update `.do-state.md`** after every commit — check off completed implementation items and add notes. This is your insurance against context loss.

---

## Phase 4: Pre-PR Validation

> **Checkpoint (MANDATORY)**: Enter Plan Mode. Re-read `.do-state.md` AND the task file. Walk through every acceptance criterion and confirm it's met. Only exit Plan Mode and proceed once you've verified completeness. Update "Current Phase" to Phase 4.

Before creating the PR, ensure everything is solid:

1. **Run the full quality suite:**
   ```
   pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test && pnpm build
   ```
   Fix any failures before proceeding.

2. **Verify documentation sync** — grep for references to anything you changed and update stale docs.

3. **Run task completion validation** (BLOCKING — do not skip):
   Dispatch the `$task-completion-validator` agent with the active task file and current branch. This agent cross-references:
   - Research findings against the implementation checklist (did every identified problem get a checklist item?)
   - Checklist items against the git diff (did every checked item produce real code changes?)
   - Acceptance criteria against the test suite (does every criterion have test or manual verification?)
   - UI inputs against backend propagation (does every new form field reach the API?)
   - Multi-resource selection logic (do lookup functions accept a discriminator when multiple variants exist?)

   **If the validator reports FAIL**: fix every CRITICAL and HIGH finding before proceeding. Convert unaddressed research findings into checklist items (and implement them) or into explicit backlog tasks with references. Do NOT archive the task until the validator passes or all gaps are explicitly deferred.

4. **Move the task file** from `tasks/active/` to `tasks/archive/` and commit.

5. **Update `.do-state.md`**: Check off Phase 4.

---

## Phase 5: Review

> **Checkpoint**: Re-read `.do-state.md`. Confirm Phases 1-4 are complete. Update "Current Phase" to Phase 5.

Dispatch review based on what the PR touches. **Always include** `$task-completion-validator` in addition to the domain-specific reviewers:

| PR touches | Skill | What it checks |
|------------|-------|----------------|
| **Always** | `$task-completion-validator` | Planned vs. actual work — research gaps, unwired UI, missing tests |
| Go code (`packages/vm-agent/`) | `$go-specialist` | Concurrency, resource leaks, Go idioms |
| TypeScript API (`apps/api/`) | `$cloudflare-specialist` | D1, KV, Workers patterns |
| UI code (`apps/web/`, `packages/ui/`) | `$ui-ux-specialist` | Accessibility, layout, interactions |
| Auth, credentials, tokens | `$security-auditor` | Credential safety, OWASP, JWT |
| Environment variables | `$env-validator` | GH_ vs GITHUB_, deployment mapping |
| Documentation changes | `$doc-sync-validator` | Docs match code reality |
| Business logic, config | `$constitution-validator` | No hardcoded values |
| Tests added/changed | `$test-engineer` | Coverage, realism, TDD compliance |

Address every bug or correctness issue raised. Push fixes and re-run quality checks.

**STOP: Wait for all review agents to complete before proceeding.** If you launched reviewers in background, you MUST wait for their results and address findings before moving to Phase 6. Do NOT use idle time to jump ahead to PR creation.

**Update `.do-state.md`**: When dispatching reviewers, immediately add each one to the "Phase 5: Review Tracker" section with status `DISPATCHED`. Update each reviewer's status as results arrive. **Phase 5 CANNOT be checked off until every dispatched reviewer shows `PASS` or `ADDRESSED`.** If you re-read the state file and any reviewer is still `DISPATCHED`, you are NOT done with Phase 5 — wait for it.

Example state file entries:
```markdown
## Phase 5: Review Tracker
- [x] task-completion-validator — PASS, no critical findings
- [ ] security-auditor — DISPATCHED (agent-id: abc123)
- [x] cloudflare-specialist — ADDRESSED, 1 medium fixed in commit def456
```

---

## Phase 6: Staging Verification (BLOCKING — DO NOT SKIP)

> **Checkpoint**: Re-read `.do-state.md`. Confirm Phases 1-5 are complete. **Specifically for Phase 5**: verify the "Phase 5: Review Tracker" section has ZERO reviewers with status `DISPATCHED`. Every reviewer must show `PASS` or `ADDRESSED`. If any reviewer is still outstanding, STOP — go back to Phase 5 and wait for it. Update "Current Phase" to Phase 6.

If this PR includes **any code changes** (not just docs/tasks), deploy to staging and verify before creating the PR.

> **Skip this phase** only for documentation-only, config-only, or task-file-only changes.

Before staging or PR creation, remove or replace prototype-only artifacts unless the user explicitly requested shipping the prototype itself. A prototype page that exists only to demonstrate an idea is not a completed product feature.

### 6a. Standard Verification (All Code Changes)

> **Use the Cloudflare API throughout this phase.** You have direct access to staging infrastructure via `$CF_TOKEN`. Query D1 to verify migrations and data, read KV to check feature flags, inspect DNS for workspace routing — all without navigating the admin UI. This is faster and more precise than Playwright-based observation. See `.claude/rules/32-cf-api-debugging.md` for the full cheat sheet and copy-paste commands.

1. **Check for existing staging deployments** before triggering your own:
   ```bash
   gh run list --workflow=deploy-staging.yml --status=in_progress --status=queued --json databaseId,status,createdAt,headBranch
   ```
   - If there are **active or queued runs**, wait at least **5 minutes** from the most recent run's `createdAt` before triggering yours. Check again after waiting — if another run started in the meantime, wait another 5 minutes.
   - If there are **no active runs**, proceed immediately.

2. **Trigger the staging deployment manually:**
   ```bash
   gh workflow run deploy-staging.yml --ref <your-branch-name>
   ```
   Then watch for it to complete:
   ```bash
   # Wait a few seconds for the run to register, then watch it
   sleep 5
   gh run list --workflow=deploy-staging.yml --branch=<your-branch-name> --limit=1 --json databaseId,status
   gh run watch <run-id>
   ```
   If the deployment fails, inspect logs with `gh run view <run-id> --log-failed`, fix the issue, and re-trigger.

3. **Open the live app** using Playwright — navigate to `app.sammy.party` (staging).

4. **Authenticate** using the staging smoke/API token via token-login API:
   ```
   POST https://api.sammy.party/api/auth/token-login
   Body: { "token": "<SAM_PLAYWRIGHT_PRIMARY_USER env var>" }
   ```
   Do this inside Playwright so the browser context receives the session cookie, then navigate that browser to `https://app.sammy.party`. Do not exchange the staging smoke/API token against `SAM_API_URL`; these tokens correctly fail against production. If the env var is not set, ask the human for credentials.

5. **Query staging state via Cloudflare API** before testing in the browser:
   - **After migration changes**: query D1 `d1_migrations` table and verify new tables/columns exist
   - **After KV-dependent changes**: read KV keys to confirm expected values
   - **After DNS/routing changes**: query DNS records to verify workspace subdomains
   - This catches data-layer issues instantly — don't wait until a Playwright test fails to discover the migration didn't run

6. **Verify the changed behavior works end-to-end:**
   - **UI changes**: interact as a real user — click buttons, submit forms, navigate pages
   - **API/backend changes**: verify affected endpoints respond correctly and downstream behavior works through the UI

7. **Report findings** to the user with evidence (screenshots, Playwright observations, or CF API query results).

8. **If issues are found**: query D1/KV/DNS via CF API to understand the actual state BEFORE changing code. Then fix, push, re-deploy, and re-verify. Do NOT proceed to PR creation with known staging failures.

### 6b. Infrastructure Verification (MANDATORY for Infrastructure Changes)

If the PR touches **any** of: `packages/cloud-init/`, `packages/vm-agent/`, `scripts/deploy/` (VM provisioning infrastructure), DNS record logic, TLS certificates, or VM agent port/protocol — you MUST complete these additional steps. **This is not optional. This is the gate that prevents catastrophic production failures.**

1. **Provision a real VM** — create a test workspace on staging that triggers full VM provisioning via cloud-init.
2. **Wait for heartbeat** — verify that the VM agent starts and sends heartbeats to the control plane within 2 minutes. If heartbeats do not arrive, the change is broken.
3. **Verify workspace access** — confirm the workspace is reachable via its `ws-*` subdomain and that terminal/agent sessions function.
4. **If TLS-related** — verify HTTPS connections to the VM agent succeed with valid certificate negotiation.
5. **Clean up** — delete the test workspace and node.
6. **Record evidence** — report to the user: "VM provisioned, heartbeat received at [time], workspace accessible at [URL]" or "FAILED: [specific failure]".

**If infrastructure verification fails, DO NOT create the PR. DO NOT merge. Fix the issue first.**

> **Why this is mandatory**: The TLS YAML indentation bug (the retained incident lesson in this rule) shipped to production because staging verification only checked UI rendering and API responses. Nobody provisioned a VM. The result: all workspace provisioning broke for ~2.5 hours in production.

### No Self-Exemptions

**Fixing a broken gate does not exempt you from the gate.** If staging is currently broken by the bug you are fixing, deploy your fix branch to staging and verify it *fixes* the broken state. "This is the fix for the thing the gate tests" is the **strongest** reason to run the gate, not a reason to skip it.

### If You Already Created the PR Without Completing Phase 6

You made a mistake. Close the PR, complete staging verification, then re-open. Do NOT merge a PR that skipped Phase 6 and "verify post-merge" — that is how bugs reach production.

**Update `.do-state.md`**: Record staging verification results. Check off Phase 6.

---

## Phase 7: Pull Request & Post-Merge Deploy Monitoring

> **Checkpoint**: Re-read `.do-state.md`. Confirm ALL Phases 1-6 are complete. If any phase is unchecked, GO BACK and complete it. Update "Current Phase" to Phase 7.

1. **Create the PR** using `gh pr create`:
   - Title: short, under 70 characters
   - Body: use the PR template from `.github/pull_request_template.md`

2. **Push and wait for CI.** Check GitHub Actions:
   ```
   gh pr checks <pr-number> --watch
   ```

3. **If CI fails or any check reports failure:** inspect logs, fix issues, commit, push, repeat. Do not hand-wave failed Preflight Evidence, SonarCloud, advisory, or non-required checks as irrelevant. If a check is red, it blocks merge unless the repository explicitly documents that exact check as non-blocking or a human explicitly approves the exception in the PR.

4. **If the user requested draft PR / do-not-merge:** create or update the PR as draft, report status to the user, and STOP. Do not convert it to ready-for-review and do not merge.

5. **Once CI is fully green**, merge the PR:
   ```
   gh pr merge <pr-number> --squash --delete-branch
   ```

6. **Clean up the worktree:**
   ```
   cd /workspaces/simple-agent-manager
   git worktree remove ../sam-<short-name>
   ```

7. **Pull main** to stay current:
   ```
   git pull origin main
   ```

### 7b. Post-Merge Production Deploy Monitoring (MANDATORY)

After merging to main, you MUST monitor the production deployment to completion. **Do NOT consider the task done until the deploy succeeds or you have alerted the user about a failure.**

1. **Wait for the Deploy Production workflow to start** (usually within 30 seconds of merge):
   ```bash
   sleep 10
   gh run list --workflow=deploy.yml --branch=main --limit=1 --json databaseId,status,conclusion,createdAt
   ```

2. **Watch it to completion:**
   ```bash
   gh run watch <run-id>
   ```

3. **If the deploy succeeds**: Report to the user: "Production deploy succeeded. Changes are live."

4. **If the deploy FAILS**: This is critical. You MUST:
   - Immediately inspect the failure: `gh run view <run-id> --log-failed`
   - **Alert the user immediately** with:
     - The fact that the production deploy failed
     - The specific failure reason (e.g., missing secret, build error, Pulumi failure)
     - Whether this is something the agent can fix (code issue) or requires human intervention (missing secrets, infrastructure config)
   - If it's a code issue you introduced: create a hotfix branch and PR, run the required checks, merge through the PR path, and monitor the next deploy. Do NOT commit directly to main unless a human explicitly authorizes an emergency exception.
   - If it requires human intervention (missing secrets, permissions, external config): **tell the user explicitly what action they need to take** and do NOT silently move on

5. **Check for pre-existing deploy failures**: Before monitoring your own deploy, check if recent deploys have been failing:
   ```bash
   gh run list --workflow=deploy.yml --limit=5 --json conclusion,createdAt,displayTitle
   ```
   If the last several deploys have all failed, **alert the user immediately** — there may be a systemic configuration issue that is blocking all deployments. Do not assume your merge will deploy successfully just because CI passed.

> **Why this is mandatory**: On 2026-04-23, production deploys failed silently for 2 days due to a missing `GH_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. Multiple agents merged PRs without noticing. 6+ changes accumulated undeployed with no one aware. This step exists to ensure deploy failures are caught immediately, not days later.

7. **Delete `.do-state.md`** — the workflow is complete.

---

## Guiding Principles

- **Autonomy**: Complete the entire flow without asking the user unless genuinely blocked.
- **Transparency**: Report progress at each phase transition.
- **Safety**: Push often, never force-push, never commit to main (except the task file).
- **Quality**: Every shortcut now is a bug later. Follow the rules.
- **Iteration**: Review feedback is not optional — address it all.
- **Deploy awareness**: A merged PR is not shipped until the deploy succeeds. Monitor it.
