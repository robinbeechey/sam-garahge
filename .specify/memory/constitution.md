# Simple Agent Manager Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Open Source Sustainability

The project is open source first. All core functionality MUST be available under an OSI-approved license
(AGPL-3.0). Monetization pathways (hosted services, enterprise features, support contracts) are
encouraged but MUST NOT compromise the open source core.

**Rules:**

- Core platform functionality remains fully open source
- Enterprise/premium features, if any, MUST be clearly separated (e.g., `enterprise/` directory)
- Sustainability mechanisms (sponsorships, hosted offerings) are documented in ROADMAP.md
- No open-core bait-and-switch: features announced as OSS stay OSS

**Rationale:** Sustainable open source projects balance community contribution with maintainer viability.
Transparency about monetization builds trust.

### II. Infrastructure Stability (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

This is infrastructure software. Users depend on it for their AI coding environments. Reliability is
paramount. Bugs in this codebase can cause data loss, unexpected costs, or security vulnerabilities.

**Rules:**

- Test coverage MUST exceed 90% for critical paths (VM provisioning, DNS management, idle detection)
- Test coverage SHOULD exceed 80% overall
- TDD is REQUIRED for all critical paths: tests written → tests fail → implementation → tests pass
- All cloud provider API interactions MUST have integration tests against mock or sandbox environments
- Breaking changes require migration guides and deprecation warnings one minor version in advance
- No PR merges with failing tests or coverage regressions

**Rationale:** Infrastructure failures cascade. High test coverage is insurance against regression.

### III. Documentation Excellence

Every feature, API, and architectural decision MUST be documented. Documentation is a first-class
deliverable, not an afterthought.

**Rules:**

- Public APIs MUST have complete reference documentation with examples
- Every public user journey has a corresponding guide in `apps/www/src/content/docs/docs/guides/`
- Public architecture documentation is recorded in `apps/www/src/content/docs/docs/architecture/`
- Code comments reference relevant public docs, specs, or task records using current paths
- Public quickstart content lives in `apps/www/src/content/docs/docs/quickstart.md`
- Product change history lives in public docs/blog content or task/spec records, not a root changelog

**Rationale:** Good documentation reduces support burden, accelerates contributor onboarding, and
demonstrates project maturity.

### IV. Approachable Code & UX

Usability applies to both end users AND developers. The "happy path" should be delightful and obvious.
Code should read like well-written prose.

**Rules:**

- Default configuration works out-of-the-box for common use cases
- Error messages are actionable: explain what went wrong AND how to fix it
- Code follows single responsibility principle: one function/class does one thing
- Functions under 50 lines; files under 500 lines (excluding tests), mandatory split above 800 lines
- Variable/function names are self-documenting; avoid abbreviations
- Complex logic MUST have inline comments explaining "why", not "what"
- UI interactions provide immediate feedback (loading states, confirmations)

**Rationale:** Approachable code invites contribution. Clear UX reduces friction and support requests.

### V. Transparent Roadmap

Project direction is visible in the repository. Contributors should understand what's planned, what's
in progress, and what's completed.

**Rules:**

- ROADMAP.md outlines phases, priorities, and target milestones
- GitHub Projects or Issues track work in progress
- Milestones group related issues for release planning
- Major features have corresponding spec documents in `/specs/`
- Completed features link to their implementing PRs

**Rationale:** Transparency enables community alignment and prevents duplicate effort.

### VI. Automated Quality Gates

Contributors MUST be guided toward success automatically. Humans shouldn't have to remember style rules
or run tests manually.

**Rules:**

- Pre-commit hooks enforce formatting and linting (Husky + lint-staged)
- CI runs on every PR: lint, typecheck, test, coverage check
- Branch protection requires passing CI and code review
- Commit messages follow Conventional Commits (enforced by commitlint)
- Dependabot or Renovate keeps dependencies current
- Security scanning (Trivy, npm audit) runs in CI

**Rationale:** Automation catches issues early and consistently, reducing review burden.

### VII. Inclusive Contribution

All contributions are welcome: code, documentation, bug reports, feature requests, translations,
design feedback. The project actively lowers barriers to entry.

**Rules:**

- CONTRIBUTING.md provides clear getting-started instructions
- Issues labeled `good-first-issue` exist for newcomers
- Code review feedback is constructive and educational
- No contribution is too small (typo fixes are valid contributions)
- Discussions and decisions happen in public (GitHub Issues/Discussions)
- Code of Conduct (Contributor Covenant) is enforced

**Rationale:** Diverse contributors strengthen the project. Inclusive practices expand the contributor pool.

### VIII. AI-Friendly Repository

AI coding agents (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor) are first-class development tools. The repository
structure MUST help agents understand and contribute effectively.

**Rules:**

- CLAUDE.md at repository root provides project reference context (concise, universally applicable)
- `.claude/rules/*.md` provides auto-loaded behavioral rules for Claude Code
- AGENTS.md provides detailed build/test/convention instructions for non-Claude AI agents
- Each package MAY have its own AGENTS.md with package-specific context
- File and directory names are descriptive and predictable
- Code follows consistent patterns that agents can learn from existing code
- Comments reference documentation paths agents can follow
- Complex business logic is co-located, not scattered across files

**Rationale:** AI agents amplify developer productivity when given proper context. Investing in agent
ergonomics pays dividends.

### IX. Clean Code Architecture

Code is organized by domain responsibility. Domain logic, reusable utilities, and use-case specific
code are clearly separated.

**Rules:**

- Monorepo structure with pnpm workspaces + Turborepo:
  - `apps/` - Deployable applications (UI, API, workers)
  - `packages/` - Shared, reusable libraries (providers, cloud-init, shared types)
  - `scripts/` - VM-side scripts and tooling
  - `apps/www/src/content/docs/docs/` - Public documentation
  - `specs/` - Feature specifications
- Dependencies flow inward: apps → packages, never packages → apps
- No circular dependencies between packages
- Each package has a clear, single purpose (documented in its README)
- Shared code is extracted only when used by 2+ consumers (no premature abstraction)

**Rationale:** Clear boundaries reduce cognitive load and enable independent testing and deployment.

### X. Simplicity & Clarity

Complexity is the enemy. Every abstraction, pattern, and dependency MUST justify its existence.

**Rules:**

- YAGNI: Don't build features until needed
- KISS: Prefer simple solutions; clever code is hard to debug
- New dependencies require justification in PR description
- Abstractions require 2+ concrete use cases before extraction
- Configuration has sensible defaults; advanced options are optional
- Architecture can be explained in a single diagram
- If something takes >30 minutes to understand, it needs refactoring or documentation
- **Official SDKs First**: When interacting with external services (APIs, cloud providers), ALWAYS prefer official SDKs over custom HTTP/API code. Official SDKs provide type safety, handle edge cases, support retries, and are maintained by the service provider. Custom API wrappers are only acceptable when no official SDK exists.

**Rationale:** Simple systems are easier to operate, debug, and extend. Complexity compounds over time. Official SDKs reduce maintenance burden and improve reliability.

### XI. No Hardcoded Values (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

All business logic values, URLs, timeouts, limits, and configuration MUST be configurable. Hardcoded values create technical debt and make the system inflexible.

**Rules:**

- **NO hardcoded URLs**: All API endpoints, callback URLs, and service addresses MUST derive from environment variables or configuration
- **NO hardcoded timeouts**: All duration values (idle timeout, token expiry, retry delays) MUST be configurable via environment variables with sensible defaults
- **NO hardcoded limits**: All limits (max workspaces, max sessions, rate limits) MUST be configurable
- **NO hardcoded identifiers**: Issuer names, audience values, key IDs MUST derive from deployment configuration
- **Defaults are acceptable**: A hardcoded DEFAULT value with env var override is the correct pattern
- **Constants for truly constant values**: Only mathematical constants, protocol versions, and similar invariants may be hardcoded

**Correct Pattern:**

```typescript
// ✅ GOOD: Configurable with sensible default
const IDLE_TIMEOUT = parseInt(process.env.IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS || '1800');
const ISSUER = `https://api.${env.BASE_DOMAIN}`;

// ❌ BAD: Hardcoded values
const IDLE_TIMEOUT = 1800;
const ISSUER = 'https://api.workspaces.example.com';
```

**Configuration Sources (in order of precedence):**

1. Environment variables (runtime)
2. Cloudflare Worker bindings (env.VAR_NAME)
3. Default values in code (fallback only)

**Rationale:** Hardcoded values require code changes for configuration. This violates twelve-factor principles, complicates deployment across environments, and creates hidden coupling between code and infrastructure.

### XII. Zero-to-Production Deployability (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

This is an open source project. Every architectural decision, infrastructure change, and feature addition
MUST consider two audiences equally: users upgrading an existing deployment AND users deploying from
scratch to their own infrastructure accounts.

**Rules:**

- **From-scratch parity**: Any feature that works on the hosted platform MUST also work for a fresh
  self-hosted deployment following the setup guide. No "works on our infra but not yours" situations.
- **Infrastructure as Code for all resources**: Every infrastructure resource (D1 databases, KV namespaces,
  Durable Object namespaces, R2 buckets, DNS records) MUST be provisionable via Pulumi or documented
  setup scripts. Manual console clicks are not acceptable as the only setup path.
- **Migrations must work from zero**: Database migrations MUST be replayable from an empty database to
  the current state. Fresh installs run the full migration chain. There is no separate "initial schema"
  to maintain — migrations are the single source of truth for database structure.
- **Self-hosting docs updated in the same PR**: When adding infrastructure requirements (new bindings,
  new secrets, new services), update `apps/www/src/content/docs/docs/guides/self-hosting.md` in the same change. Do not defer.
- **Minimal external dependencies at deploy time**: The deployment should not depend on specific CI
  providers, specific DNS providers beyond Cloudflare, or any service that the self-hoster cannot
  substitute. GitHub Actions workflows are conveniences, not requirements.
- **Architecture documentation for infrastructure changes**: When introducing new infrastructure
  components (e.g., Durable Objects, new storage layers), document the decision in `apps/www/src/content/docs/docs/architecture/` with
  the self-hosting implications explicitly addressed.

**Validation Checklist (for architectural changes):**

- [ ] Can a new user deploy this from zero using only the setup guide?
- [ ] Are all new infrastructure resources in the Pulumi stack or documented setup scripts?
- [ ] Does the deploy workflow handle both "first deploy" and "upgrade" paths?
- [ ] Are new secrets/env vars documented with descriptions of how to obtain them?
- [ ] Is there a teardown path that cleanly removes all new resources?

**Rationale:** Open source infrastructure software lives or dies by self-hostability. If deploying from
scratch is painful or undocumented, the project is effectively closed-source in practice. Every
architectural choice that makes self-hosting harder narrows the user base and contradicts Principle I.

### XIII. Fail-Fast Error Detection (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Errors MUST be detected and surfaced at the earliest possible point. Silent failures that propagate invalid state across system boundaries cause data corruption, misrouted data, and bugs that are extremely difficult to diagnose. When in doubt, reject and log rather than silently accept.

**Rules:**

- **Validate identity at every boundary**: When data crosses a system boundary (API endpoint, Durable Object, VM agent, WebSocket), validate ALL identity fields (workspaceId, projectId, sessionId, taskId, userId) before processing. Never trust that upstream already validated.
- **Fail loudly on ID mismatches**: If a message claims to belong to session X but the workspace is linked to session Y, reject the message with an explicit error. Never silently route it to session X or any other destination.
- **Drop rather than misroute**: When identity validation fails, it is always better to drop a message (and log the failure) than to deliver it to the wrong destination. Misrouted data is worse than missing data.
- **Structured logging on every rejection**: Every validation failure MUST be logged with full diagnostic context: the IDs involved (workspace, project, session, task), what was expected vs. what was received, and the action taken (rejected, dropped, etc.).
- **No silent no-ops on nil/empty IDs**: If a critical identity field (sessionId, workspaceId, projectId) is nil, empty, or missing where it is required, fail immediately with an error. Do not silently skip processing.
- **Assert preconditions at function entry**: Functions that require specific state (e.g., "sessionId must be set") MUST assert that state at entry, not discover it mid-execution.

**Correct Pattern:**

```typescript
// GOOD: Validate and fail early with context
if (workspace.chatSessionId && workspace.chatSessionId !== sessionId) {
  console.error('Message routing mismatch', {
    workspaceId,
    expectedSessionId: workspace.chatSessionId,
    receivedSessionId: sessionId,
    action: 'rejected',
  });
  throw errors.badRequest(
    `Session mismatch: workspace is linked to session ${workspace.chatSessionId}`
  );
}

// BAD: Silently accept whatever sessionId is provided
const result = await persistMessage(sessionId, content);
```

**Rationale:** The workspace message routing bug demonstrated that silent acceptance of unvalidated identity fields causes messages to appear in wrong chat sessions. This class of bug is undetectable by users and erodes trust in the system. Fail-fast validation at every boundary prevents data corruption and makes failures immediately visible in logs for rapid diagnosis.

### Naming Conventions

- **Files**: kebab-case (`idle-check.ts`, `hetzner-provider.ts`)
- **Directories**: kebab-case (`cloud-init/`, `dns-manager/`)
- **Classes/Types**: PascalCase (`HetznerProvider`, `WorkspaceConfig`)
- **Functions/Variables**: camelCase (`createWorkspace`, `idleThreshold`)
- **Constants**: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE (`DEFAULT_IDLE_MINUTES`, `API_VERSION`)
- **Test files**: `*.test.ts` co-located with source or in `__tests__/`

## Infrastructure as Code Guidelines

This project manages cloud infrastructure (Cloudflare Workers, Pages, R2, KV, DNS) and VM provisioning
(Hetzner Cloud). All infrastructure MUST be declarative, version-controlled, and reproducible.

### IaC Tooling Strategy

**Hybrid Approach: Pulumi + Wrangler**

The project uses a deliberate separation of concerns between two tools:

**Pulumi (Infrastructure Provisioning)**

- Provisions Cloudflare resources: D1 databases, KV namespaces, R2 buckets, DNS records
- Uses official `@pulumi/cloudflare` provider (TypeScript)
- State stored in Cloudflare R2 bucket (S3-compatible, self-hosted, no Pulumi Cloud)
- Infrastructure code lives in `infra/` directory
- Provides proper state management, drift detection, and idempotency

**Wrangler (Application Deployment)**

- Deploys Workers and Pages projects (application code)
- Runs D1 database migrations
- Configures Worker secrets
- Uses `wrangler.toml` for deployment configuration (not resource creation)

**Why This Split:**

- Pulumi excels at infrastructure lifecycle (create/update/delete with state tracking)
- Wrangler excels at deployment workflows (it understands Workers internals)
- Wrangler's "auto-provisioning" is limited and lacks state management
- Custom API code is brittle and duplicates SDK functionality

**Official SDK Usage:**

- Use `cloudflare` npm package (official TypeScript SDK) for any direct API calls
- Use `@pulumi/cloudflare` for infrastructure provisioning
- NEVER write custom HTTP wrappers for Cloudflare APIs

**Rules:**

- All infrastructure changes go through PR review (no manual console changes)
- Infrastructure drift is checked quarterly (compare deployed state vs config)
- Never use `--force` or bypass flags without documented justification
- Pulumi state bucket is the ONE manual prerequisite for deployment

### Environment Management

Three environments with clear separation:

| Environment | Wrangler Command                | Purpose                           |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Development | `wrangler dev`                  | Local development with hot reload |
| Staging     | `wrangler deploy --env staging` | Pre-production testing            |
| Production  | `wrangler deploy`               | Live user-facing deployment       |

**Rules:**

- Environment-specific config uses `[env.staging]` sections in `wrangler.toml`
- Environment variables differ by environment (documented in README)
- Never deploy directly to production without staging verification
- Database migrations tested in staging before production

### Secrets Management

Secrets are sensitive values (API keys, tokens, passwords) that MUST NOT be exposed.

**Rules:**

- NEVER hardcode secrets in source code, config files, or commit history
- Use Cloudflare Workers secrets: `wrangler secret put SECRET_NAME`
- Local development uses `.dev.vars` file (gitignored)
- Document all required secrets in README with descriptions (not values)
- Secrets follow principle of least privilege (minimal required permissions)
- Rotate secrets on suspected compromise; schedule rotation for long-lived secrets

**Secret Files (gitignored):**

```
.dev.vars          # Local Cloudflare Workers secrets
.env               # General environment variables
.env.local         # Local overrides
*.pem              # Private keys
*credentials*      # Any credential files
```

**Required Secrets Documentation (in README):**

```markdown
## Required Secrets

| Secret Name       | Description                 | Where to Get                      |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| HETZNER_TOKEN     | Hetzner Cloud API token     | Hetzner console → API tokens      |
| CF_API_TOKEN      | Cloudflare API token        | Cloudflare dashboard → API tokens |
| ANTHROPIC_API_KEY | User-provided per workspace | User provides                     |
```

### Resource Naming Conventions

Consistent naming enables identification and automation:

| Resource Type | Pattern                     | Example                              |
| ------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Workers       | `{project}-{env}`           | `simple-agent-manager-staging`       |
| KV Namespaces | `{project}-{env}-{purpose}` | `simple-agent-manager-prod-sessions` |
| R2 Buckets    | `{project}-{env}-{purpose}` | `simple-agent-manager-prod-backups`  |
| D1 Databases  | `{project}-{env}`           | `simple-agent-manager-staging`       |
| DNS Records   | `*.{vm-id}.vm.{domain}`     | `*.abc123.vm.example.com`            |
| Hetzner VMs   | `ws-{workspace-id}`         | `ws-abc123`                          |

**Rules:**

- All names lowercase with hyphens (no underscores or camelCase)
- Include environment in name for clarity
- VM labels include `managed-by: simple-agent-manager` for filtering

### Cloud-Init Scripts

Cloud-init scripts configure VMs on first boot. They live in `scripts/vm/`.

**Rules:**

- Scripts MUST be idempotent (safe to run multiple times)
- Use template variables for dynamic values: `${VARIABLE_NAME}`
- Test scripts in Docker before deploying to cloud
- Log all significant actions for debugging
- Include error handling with descriptive messages
- Scripts are versioned and tagged with releases

**Script Structure:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail  # Exit on error, undefined vars, pipe failures

# Logging function
log() { echo "[$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')] $*"; }

log "Starting cloud-init script v${SCRIPT_VERSION}"

# ... script body ...

log "Cloud-init completed successfully"
```

### Infrastructure Testing

Infrastructure changes require testing before production deployment.

**Testing Levels:**

1. **Local**: `wrangler dev` for Worker logic testing
2. **Unit Tests**: Mock cloud provider APIs in `packages/providers/`
3. **Integration Tests**: Deploy to staging, verify end-to-end
4. **Cloud-Init Tests**: Run scripts in Docker container locally

**Rules:**

- All provider API interactions have mock-based unit tests
- Critical paths (VM creation, DNS management) have integration tests
- Cloud-init scripts tested in Docker before cloud deployment
- Staging deployment required before production for infrastructure changes

### Deployment & Rollback

**Deployment Process:**

1. Merge to `main` triggers CI/CD
2. CI runs tests, lint, typecheck
3. Agent triggers staging deployment manually via `gh workflow run deploy-staging.yml --ref <branch>`
4. Staging verification confirms the deployment works before merge
5. Production deployment creates immutable version in Cloudflare

**Rollback Procedures:**

- Cloudflare maintains version history; rollback via dashboard or API
- For critical issues: `wrangler rollback` to previous version
- Database rollbacks require migration scripts (test in staging first)
- Document rollback steps in runbooks for each component

**Rules:**

- Never delete previous versions immediately after deployment
- Gradual rollouts for high-risk changes (Cloudflare supports percentage-based)
- Incident response: rollback first, investigate second
- Post-incident: document root cause and prevention in ADR

## Multi-Tenant Architecture Guidelines

This platform operates as a multi-tenant SaaS where users bring their own cloud credentials. We manage
authentication, orchestration, and workspace metadata while users retain ownership of their infrastructure.

### Data Ownership Model

**What We Store (Cloudflare D1/KV):**

- User profiles (from GitHub OAuth)
- User's Hetzner API tokens (AES-GCM encrypted with per-user initialization vectors)
- Workspace metadata (name, repo, status, VM ID, DNS record ID)
- JWT signing keys
- Sessions and rate limiting data

**What We DON'T Store:**

- VMs (created on user's Hetzner account, billed to them)
- Code (lives on Git provider and in user's VMs)

**Rules:**

- Users MUST be able to delete all their data via account deletion
- Encrypted credentials use AES-GCM with unique IVs per credential
- Workspace metadata is soft-deleted first, hard-deleted after 30 days
- Users can revoke their Hetzner token at any time (workspaces stop working)

### User Credential Security

**Rules:**

- NEVER log or expose decrypted credentials in error messages
- Credentials are decrypted only at point of use (just-in-time)
- Encryption key is a Worker secret, never in source code
- Failed decryption attempts are logged for security monitoring
- Credential rotation: users can update their Hetzner token without recreating workspaces

### Privacy Principles

**Rules:**

- User's code never passes through our control plane (direct GitHub ↔ VM)
- We cannot access running VMs (no SSH keys, no backdoors)
- Workspace URLs are unique per workspace, not guessable
- Idle detection and cleanup happens on the VM, not via our monitoring

## Authentication Architecture

Authentication is a first-class concern, not an afterthought. No "simple API key" shortcuts.

### Git Provider OAuth

We use [BetterAuth](https://better-auth.com) with [better-auth-cloudflare](https://github.com/zpg6/better-auth-cloudflare)
for Cloudflare-native authentication. OAuth with Git providers serves dual purposes: user authentication
AND repository access.

**Supported Providers:**

- GitHub (primary, implemented first)
- GitLab (future)
- Bitbucket (future)

**OAuth Scopes (GitHub example):**

- `read:user` - User profile information
- `user:email` - User email addresses
- `repo` - Full repository access (read/write, list repos)

**Rules:**

- Git provider OAuth is the ONLY authentication method (no email/password)
- OAuth tokens are stored encrypted in D1 (enables repo listing, cloning, pushing)
- Token refresh is handled automatically by BetterAuth
- BetterAuth manages sessions via Cloudflare KV
- BetterAuth auto-generates database tables (users, sessions, accounts)
- Rate limiting is enabled by default (100 requests/minute per IP)
- All auth routes are under `/api/auth/*`
- Design for multiple providers: abstract Git operations behind provider interface

**Configuration Pattern:**

```typescript
// apps/api/src/auth.ts
import { betterAuth } from 'better-auth';
import { withCloudflare } from 'better-auth-cloudflare';

export function createAuth(env: CloudflareBindings, cf?: IncomingRequestCfProperties) {
  return betterAuth({
    ...withCloudflare(
      {
        d1: { db: drizzle(env.DATABASE), options: { usePlural: true } },
        kv: env.KV,
      },
      {
        socialProviders: {
          github: {
            clientId: env.GITHUB_CLIENT_ID,
            clientSecret: env.GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET,
            scope: ['read:user', 'user:email', 'repo'],
          },
          // Future: gitlab, bitbucket
        },
      }
    ),
  });
}
```

**Git Token Flow:**

1. User authenticates via OAuth (e.g., GitHub)
2. We receive access token with `repo` scope
3. Token is encrypted and stored in D1 (linked to user account)
4. When creating workspace, token is decrypted and passed to VM via cloud-init
5. VM uses token for git clone/push (credential helper pattern)
6. Token can be refreshed via OAuth refresh flow

### JWT Terminal Authentication

Terminal access uses short-lived JWTs issued by the control plane and validated by VM Agents.

**Rules:**

- JWTs are RS256 signed (RSA 2048-bit minimum)
- Token lifetime: 1 hour maximum
- JWKS endpoint: `/.well-known/jwks.json` (cached, supports key rotation)
- JWT claims MUST include: `sub` (user ID), `workspace` (workspace ID), `exp`, `iss`, `aud`
- VM Agents fetch JWKS on startup and cache for 1 hour
- Token is passed via URL parameter on redirect, then exchanged for session cookie

**Terminal Access Flow:**

1. User clicks "Open Terminal" in control plane UI
2. Control plane validates session, verifies workspace ownership
3. Control plane issues JWT with workspace claim
4. Redirect to `https://ws-{id}.domain.com/?token=JWT`
5. VM Agent validates JWT against JWKS
6. VM Agent issues session cookie, proxies to terminal

### Session Management

**Rules:**

- Control plane sessions: managed by BetterAuth in Cloudflare KV
- VM Agent sessions: simple cookie with HMAC signature
- Session cookies are `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Strict`
- VM Agent session lifetime: 8 hours (user must re-auth from control plane after)

## VM Agent Guidelines

The VM Agent is a single Go binary that runs on the VM host, serving the terminal UI and managing
PTY sessions. It does NOT run in Docker.

### Single Binary Architecture

**Why Go:**

- Single static binary, no runtime dependencies
- Cross-compiles to linux/amd64 and linux/arm64
- Fast startup (milliseconds)
- Excellent PTY and WebSocket support

**Rules:**

- The agent is ONE binary with embedded UI (no separate processes)
- No ttyd dependency (agent handles PTY directly)
- No Docker for the agent (runs on VM host)
- Binary size target: <20MB uncompressed, <8MB with UPX compression

### Embedded UI Pattern

The React UI is compiled into the Go binary using Go's `embed` package.

**Build Process:**

```makefile
build: ui
    go build -o bin/vm-agent .

ui:
    cd ui && pnpm install && pnpm build
```

**Rules:**

- The VM agent has no embedded web UI (removed — the control plane app at `apps/web` provides all user-facing interfaces)
- The Go binary is a pure API server with no static file serving

### PTY Management

**Rules:**

- Use `github.com/creack/pty` for PTY spawning
- Shell command: `devcontainer exec --workspace-folder /workspace bash`
- Support terminal resize (SIGWINCH handling)
- Multiple concurrent sessions per workspace
- Clean session teardown on disconnect

**WebSocket Protocol:**

- Use `github.com/gorilla/websocket`
- Binary frames for terminal I/O
- JSON frames for control messages (resize, heartbeat)
- Heartbeat every 30 seconds, timeout after 90 seconds

### Distribution Strategy

**Rules:**

- Build via goreleaser automation for multi-arch: `vm-agent-linux-amd64`, `vm-agent-linux-arm64`
- Binaries are embedded in or served by the control plane (NOT downloaded from GitHub at runtime)
- Download in cloud-init from control plane: `curl -Lo /usr/local/bin/vm-agent $API_URL/agent/download?arch=amd64`
- Run as systemd service with auto-restart
- Environment config via `/etc/workspace/agent.env`
- Version MUST match control plane version (enforced by serving from same deployment)

## Self-Contained Deployment

The platform MUST be deployable without external runtime dependencies beyond the user's cloud providers.
This enables self-hosting in air-gapped or restricted environments and ensures version consistency.

### Rationale

1. **Self-Hostability**: Users deploying their own instance should not depend on our GitHub releases
2. **Version Alignment**: Control plane and VM Agent versions MUST always match to prevent compatibility issues
3. **Reliability**: No third-party service (GitHub, CDNs) can cause runtime failures
4. **Security**: Air-gapped deployments can verify all artifacts come from their own infrastructure

### Rules

**Artifacts We Build:**

- VM Agent binary MUST be served from the control plane, not external sources
- Cloud-init scripts MUST be generated by or served from the control plane
- No hardcoded URLs to GitHub, npm, or CDNs for OUR artifacts

**Allowed External Dependencies:**

- User's Git provider (GitHub, GitLab, etc.) - required for repository access
- Container registries (Docker Hub, GHCR) - required for devcontainer images
- OS package repositories (apt, apk) - required for system packages
- User's cloud provider APIs (Hetzner, etc.) - required for VM provisioning

**Version Consistency:**

- Control plane MUST serve VM Agent binaries that match its deployed version
- Cloud-init MUST request the correct architecture binary from control plane
- VM Agent MUST report its version; control plane MAY reject outdated agents

## Development Workflow

### Cloudflare-First Development

**Philosophy:** No complex local testing setups. Iterate directly on Cloudflare infrastructure.

**Rationale:** This project has many moving pieces (Workers, D1, KV, DNS, VMs, VM Agent). Setting up
a realistic local environment is impractical. Instead, we deploy frequently and test on real infrastructure.

**Rules:**

- `pnpm dev` starts local development servers (Workers miniflare, Vite) for rapid iteration
- Merge to `main` triggers automatic deployment to production
- Manual deployment available via workflow_dispatch

### Continuous Deployment

**Philosophy:** Merge to main = deploy to production. Configuration lives in GitHub, visible and editable.

**Rationale:** Deployment should be automatic and predictable. Configuration should be visible in the GitHub UI,
not buried in one-time scripts or hidden state files. This enables easy auditing and modification.

**Rules:**

- Push/merge to `main` automatically deploys to production
- All configuration lives in **GitHub Environments** (Settings → Environments → production)
- Environment **variables** (visible) for non-sensitive config: `BASE_DOMAIN`, `RESOURCE_PREFIX`
- Environment **secrets** (hidden) for sensitive values: API tokens, keys, credentials
- Deployment is idempotent: safe to re-run, only updates changed resources
- Concurrent deployments are queued, not cancelled

**GitHub Environment Configuration:**

| Type     | Name                       | Description                                              |
| -------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Variable | `BASE_DOMAIN`              | Base domain for deployment (e.g., `example.com`)         |
| Variable | `RESOURCE_PREFIX`          | Prefix for resources (default: `sam`)                    |
| Variable | `PULUMI_STATE_BUCKET`      | R2 bucket for Pulumi state (default: `sam-pulumi-state`) |
| Secret   | `CF_API_TOKEN`             | Cloudflare API token                                     |
| Secret   | `CF_ACCOUNT_ID`            | Cloudflare account ID                                    |
| Secret   | `CF_ZONE_ID`               | Cloudflare zone ID                                       |
| Secret   | `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`         | R2 access key for Pulumi state                           |
| Secret   | `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`     | R2 secret key for Pulumi state                           |
| Secret   | `PULUMI_CONFIG_PASSPHRASE` | Encryption passphrase for Pulumi state                   |
| Secret   | `GH_CLIENT_ID`             | GitHub OAuth client ID                                   |
| Secret   | `GH_CLIENT_SECRET`         | GitHub OAuth client secret                               |
| Secret   | `GH_APP_ID`                | GitHub App ID                                            |
| Secret   | `GH_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`       | GitHub App private key                                   |
| Secret   | `GH_APP_SLUG`              | GitHub App slug                                          |
| Secret   | `ENCRYPTION_KEY`           | AES-256 key (optional, auto-generated)                   |
| Secret   | `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY`          | JWT signing key (optional, auto-generated)               |
| Secret   | `JWT_PUBLIC_KEY`           | JWT verification key (optional, auto-generated)          |

**Naming Convention**: GitHub App secrets use `GH_*` prefix because GitHub Actions secret names cannot start with `GITHUB_*`. The deployment workflow (`configure-secrets.sh`) maps these to `GITHUB_*` Cloudflare Worker secrets (e.g., `GH_CLIENT_ID` → `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`, `GH_WEBHOOK_SECRET` → `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`).

**Deployment Pipeline:**

1. **Validate** - Check all required configuration exists
2. **Infrastructure** - Pulumi provisions D1, KV, R2, DNS records
3. **Configuration** - Sync Pulumi outputs to Wrangler, generate keys if needed
4. **Applications** - Build and deploy API Worker + Web UI via Wrangler
5. **Migrations** - Run database migrations
6. **Secrets** - Configure Worker secrets
7. **VM Agent** - Build and upload agent binaries to R2
8. **Validation** - Health check the deployed API

**Teardown:**

- Manual workflow_dispatch only (requires typing "DELETE")
- Uses same GitHub Environment for configuration
- Pulumi destroy removes infrastructure
- Optional: preserve database data

### Branch Strategy

- `main` - Production-ready code; protected branch
- `001-feature-name` - Feature branches (numbered for tracking)
- Release tags: `v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0`, etc.

### Pull Request Process

1. Create feature branch from `main`
2. Implement with tests (TDD for critical paths)
3. Ensure CI passes (lint, typecheck, test, coverage)
4. Request review from at least one maintainer
5. Address feedback; avoid force-push after review starts
6. Squash merge to `main` with Conventional Commit message

### Commit Message Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `ci`

Examples:

- `feat(api): add workspace creation endpoint`
- `fix(providers): handle Hetzner rate limiting`
- `docs(readme): add quickstart guide`

### Release Process

1. Create release branch or tag from `main`
2. Update CHANGELOG.md with release notes
3. Bump version in package.json files
4. Create GitHub Release with changelog excerpt
5. CI deploys to production on release tag
