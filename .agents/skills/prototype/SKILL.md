# UI Prototype Builder

Build a self-contained UI prototype inside the real web app for design exploration and UX iteration.

## Full Rules

Read `.claude/rules/37-prototype-development.md` for the complete prototype development rules. Everything below is a summary workflow.

## Workflow

### 1. Audit the Existing UI

Before building, read the current implementation to understand:
- What components and patterns already exist
- What design tokens and styles are in use
- What the current UX problems are

### 2. Create the Prototype

Create two files:

```
apps/web/src/pages/<name>-prototype/
  ├── index.tsx       # Main component — self-contained, no API calls, no auth
  └── mock-data.ts    # Stress-test mock data (long text, many items, empty states, edge cases)
```

**Critical requirements:**
- Wrap content in a scrollable container: `<div style={{ height: '100vh', overflow: 'auto' }}>`
- Use existing components (`VmSizeCard`, `@simple-agent-manager/ui`, etc.) wherever possible
- Match the app's design tokens and dark theme
- Design mobile-first (375px), then enhance for desktop (1280px)
- Include mock data that pushes UI boundaries — this is how we find where it breaks

### 3. Wire the Route

Add to `App.tsx` in the public routes section:

```typescript
import { MyPrototype } from './pages/<name>-prototype';

// In Routes, alongside other public routes:
<Route path="/prototype/<name>" element={<MyPrototype />} />
```

### 4. Start the Dev Server and Expose

```bash
cd apps/web && npx vite --host 0.0.0.0
```

Then expose the port using the SAM MCP `expose_port` tool (port 5173, protocol http). Share the resulting URL with the user.

### 5. Visual Audit

Run Playwright screenshots at both viewports:
- Mobile: 375x667
- Desktop: 1280x800

Check for: overflow, clipping, text wrapping, touch targets (44px+ min), empty states, long content handling.

Save screenshots to `.codex/tmp/playwright-screenshots/`.

## NEVER Deploy to Production

Prototypes may be committed to feature branches for collaboration. They MUST be removed before any merge to main:
- Delete prototype page directory
- Remove route from `App.tsx`
- Remove import from `App.tsx`
