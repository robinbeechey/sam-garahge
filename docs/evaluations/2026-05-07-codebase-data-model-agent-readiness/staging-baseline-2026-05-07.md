# Staging Baseline Snapshot — 2026-05-07

Captured: **2026-05-07T05:18Z – 05:20Z UTC**

This document records the Cloudflare staging infrastructure state before any evaluation-driven implementation work begins. It serves as the compatibility and rollback reference for D1 schema changes, Durable Object migrations, KV/R2 usage, and deployment pipeline health.

All queries used `$CF_TOKEN` (read-only) against the Cloudflare API. No mutations were performed.

### 2b. Observability Database (`sam-observability-staging`)

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| UUID | `8c2fa46c-3b89-428b-b235-d835b7914106` |
| File size | ~2.3 MB |
| Tables | `_cf_KV`, `d1_migrations`, `platform_errors`, `sqlite_sequence` |
| Total errors | 4,378 |

**Recent errors** (last 5, all identical):
```
source: api
level:  warn
message: "Orphaned node detected: running with no workspaces and not in warm pool"
```

These repeat every ~5 minutes (cron interval). **Pre-existing issue**: 1 running node with 0 workspaces is being flagged as orphaned by the cron sweep but not cleaned up automatically.

---

## 3. Durable Object Bindings & Migrations

From `apps/api/wrangler.toml` (checked into repo). These are top-level bindings; deploy-time `sync-wrangler-config.ts` copies them into the generated `[env.staging]` section.

| Binding Name | Class | Migration Tag | Storage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `PROJECT_DATA` | `ProjectData` | v1 | SQLite |
| `NODE_LIFECYCLE` | `NodeLifecycle` | v2 | Stateless |
| `ADMIN_LOGS` | `AdminLogs` | v3 | Stateless |
| `TASK_RUNNER` | `TaskRunner` | v4 | Stateless |
| `NOTIFICATION` | `NotificationService` | v5 | SQLite |
| `CODEX_REFRESH_LOCK` | `CodexRefreshLock` | v6 | Stateless |
| `TRIAL_COUNTER` | `TrialCounter` | v7 | SQLite |
| `TRIAL_EVENT_BUS` | `TrialEventBus` | v8 | In-memory |
| `TRIAL_ORCHESTRATOR` | `TrialOrchestrator` | v9 | SQLite |
| `PROJECT_ORCHESTRATOR` | `ProjectOrchestrator` | v10 | SQLite |
| `SAM_SESSION` | `SamSession` | v11 | SQLite |
| `PROJECT_AGENT` | `ProjectAgent` | v12 | SQLite |
| `SANDBOX` | `SandboxDO` | v13 | SQLite (Container) |

**Note**: DO internal SQLite migrations (per-instance) are managed within each DO class, not via D1. ProjectData has the most complex internal schema (19+ migrations as of spec 027).

### Container Binding

```toml
[[containers]]
class_name = "SandboxDO"
image = "./Dockerfile.sandbox"
instance_type = "basic"
max_instances = 3
```

---

## 4. KV Namespaces

| Namespace | ID |
| --- | --- |
| `sam-staging-sessions` | `cbeb633bc3794dd88a0b488d46a1922d` |

**Key count**: 2
**Key prefixes**: `platform`, `trials`

KV is used for: session tokens, rate limiting, feature flags, AI budget settings, trial state. The low key count (2) suggests most ephemeral state has expired or been cleaned up.

---

## 5. R2 Buckets

| Bucket | Created |
| --- | --- |
| `sam-pulumi-state` | 2026-03-01 |
| `sam-staging-assets` | 2026-03-01 |

### `sam-staging-assets` Contents (sample)

| Key | Size | Last Modified |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `agents/vm-agent-linux-amd64` | 13.5 MB | 2026-05-06T12:42Z |
| `agents/vm-agent-linux-arm64` | 12.6 MB | 2026-05-06T12:42Z |
| `experiments/harness-linux-amd64` | 6.1 MB | 2026-05-03T11:29Z |
| `library/<project-id>/<file-id>` (encrypted) | varies | various |

VM agent binaries were last updated during the most recent staging deploy (2026-05-06).

## 6. Deployment Pipeline Health

### Staging Deploys (last 5)

| Branch | Status | Date (UTC) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sam/compact-mode-lazy-load-tool-content` | success | 2026-05-06T12:34Z |
| `sam/stopped-workspace-auto-delete` | success | 2026-05-06T04:11Z |
| `sam/keep-running-errors-where-01kqxn` | success | 2026-05-06T04:03Z |
| `sam/use-skill-continue-sam-01kqx7` | success | 2026-05-06T02:26Z |
| `sam/use-sam-mcp-tools-01kqx2` | success | 2026-05-05T23:01Z |

All 5 most recent staging deploys succeeded. Pipeline is healthy.

### Production Deploys (last 5)

| Status | Date (UTC) |
| --- | --- |
| success | 2026-05-07T05:02Z |
| skipped | 2026-05-07T04:55Z |
| skipped | 2026-05-07T04:49Z |
| skipped | 2026-05-07T04:44Z |
| skipped | 2026-05-07T04:08Z |

The most recent production deploy succeeded. The "skipped" entries are from commits that didn't trigger a deploy (likely docs/task-only PRs with skip conditions).

### CI (last 5)

| Title | Status | Date (UTC) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Add deep codebase evaluation reports (#922) | success | 2026-05-07T04:57Z |
| Add deep codebase evaluation reports | success | 2026-05-07T04:51Z |
| Add deep codebase evaluation reports | failure | 2026-05-07T04:39Z |
| Deep codebase evaluation... | failure | 2026-05-07T04:03Z |
| Deep codebase evaluation... | cancelled | 2026-05-07T04:03Z |

CI is green on the most recent merge to main. Earlier failures were during the evaluation report integration (resolved).

---

## 7. App / API Health

| Endpoint | Status | Response |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `https://api.sammy.party/health` | 200 | `{"status":"healthy","timestamp":"2026-05-07T05:19:01.636Z"}` |
| `https://app.sammy.party` | 200 | HTML page loads |

Both staging surfaces are healthy and responding.

---

## 8. Pre-Existing Issues

### 8a. Orphaned Running Node

One node remains in `running` status with zero associated workspaces. The cron sweep detects it every 5 minutes and logs a warning to the observability DB but does not destroy it. This is generating persistent low-priority noise (the most recent 5 errors in `platform_errors` are all this warning).

**Impact on evaluation work**: Low. This is a data cleanup issue, not a pipeline or schema issue. If Wave 1 work touches node lifecycle, this orphan may be cleaned up incidentally.

### 8b. One Workspace in Error State

One workspace is in `error` status (out of 50 total, 49 deleted). This is likely a stale record from a failed provisioning attempt.

**Impact on evaluation work**: None. Does not affect schema changes or deployments.

### 8c. Observability DB Error Volume

4,378 errors in the observability database, primarily the orphaned node warning repeating every 5 minutes. At ~288 entries/day, this will continue growing. Not blocking for evaluation work but worth noting for the performance/cost track.

### 8d. Staging Last Deployed from Feature Branch

The most recent staging deploy was from `sam/compact-mode-lazy-load-tool-content` (2026-05-06T12:34Z), not from `main`. Staging may have code that diverges slightly from the current `main` HEAD. Before any evaluation implementation deploys, consider deploying from `main` first to establish a clean baseline.

---

## 9. Compatibility Notes for Evaluation Implementation

### D1 Schema Changes

- Current migration level: `0048_missions.sql` (id 57)
- New migrations should use prefix `0049_` and follow `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` pattern (never `DROP TABLE` on FK parents per rule 31)
- The CASCADE map should be checked before any table modifications: `pnpm quality:migration-safety`

### Durable Object Migrations

- Current: v13 (SandboxDO)
- New DO classes require a new `[[migrations]]` tag entry in `wrangler.toml`
- Existing DO internal SQLite migrations are incremental (ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN pattern)

### KV

- Only 2 keys present; KV is used ephemerally. No compatibility concerns for evaluation work.

### R2

- VM agent binaries refreshed on each staging deploy. Library files are encrypted and project-scoped. No compatibility concerns unless R2 bucket structure changes.

### Deployment

- Pipeline is healthy (5/5 recent staging deploys succeeded)
- Deploy from `main` first before any evaluation branch deploys to sync staging with production
